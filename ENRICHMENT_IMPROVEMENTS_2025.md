# Artist Resolution & Data Quality Improvements (2025)

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive improvements made to the SongNodes enrichment pipeline and data quality management system, implementing 2025 best practices for music metadata enrichment and human-in-the-loop validation.

---

## 🎯 Key Improvements

### 1. Upgraded Fuzzy Matching Library

**Changed:** `fuzzywuzzy` → `rapidfuzz`

**Benefits:**
- **2-3x faster performance** with C++ optimizations
- **MIT licensed** (more permissive than fuzzywuzzy)
- **More algorithms** (Jaro-Winkler, Hamming, etc.)
- **Better maintenance** (actively developed)

**Files Modified:**
- `scrapers/requirements.txt`
- `scrapers/pipelines/enrichment_pipeline.py`
- `services/metadata-enrichment/artist_populator.py`

### 2. Multi-Tier Confidence System

**Implementation:**
Three confidence tiers with automatic handling:

| Tier | Score Range | Action | Use Case |
|------|-------------|--------|----------|
| **High** | 90-100 | Auto-apply | Exact matches with minor variations |
| **Medium** | 80-89 | Apply with flag | Probable matches, track for review |
| **Low** | 70-79 | Suggestion only | Possible matches, require human validation |

**Benefits:**
- Better data governance
- Transparent quality metrics
- Audit trail for changes
- Human oversight for edge cases

### 3. Enhanced Artist Resolution

**MusicBrainz ID (MBID) as Canonical Identifier:**

Priority order for artist matching:
1. **MBID** (MusicBrainz ID) - canonical, authoritative
2. **Spotify ID** - service-specific identifier
3. **Fuzzy name matching** with RapidFuzz
4. **Create new artist** with full metadata

**Intelligent Disambiguation:**

For common artist names (e.g., "Matrix", "DJ Shadow"), uses:
- **MBID match** = +100 score (highest priority)
- **Spotify popularity** = +50 max (0-100 scale × 0.5)
- **Fuzzy name match** = +30 max (RapidFuzz ratio × 0.3)

**Example:**
```python
# Before: Only Spotify ID matching
artist_id = get_or_create_artist(name="Matrix", spotify_id="abc123")

# After: Multi-source with disambiguation
artist_id = get_or_create_artist(
    name="Matrix",
    spotify_id="abc123",
    musicbrainz_id="mbid-xyz-789",
    spotify_popularity=75,
    genres=["Drum and Bass", "Jungle"]
)
```

### 4. Data Quality Review Interface

**New Feature:** Human-in-the-loop validation UI

**Components:**
- `services/rest-api/routers/data_quality.py` - Backend API
- `frontend/src/components/DataQualityReview.tsx` - React component
- `frontend/src/components/DataQualityReview.css` - Styling

**Features:**

#### Statistics Dashboard
- Total tracks needing review
- Breakdown by confidence level (high/medium/low)
- Daily review activity metrics
- Approval/rejection rates

#### Filtering System
- Filter by confidence level
- Filter by issue type:
  - Missing genre
  - Low confidence
  - Unknown artist
- Pagination support (50 tracks per page)

#### Setlist Context View
Displays surrounding tracks to help reviewers make informed decisions:
- **Previous 2-3 tracks** (genre, BPM, key, energy)
- **Next 2-3 tracks**
- DJ name and event date
- Genre consistency analysis
- BPM flow visualization

**Example Context:**
```
Playlist: "Anjunadeep Miami 2024"
DJ: Lane 8
Position: Track 15 of 42

Previous tracks:
  ▶ Reflections - Sound Quelle [Progressive House, 122 BPM, Am]
  ▶ Rising Sun - Yotto [Progressive House, 123 BPM, F#m]

→ Current Track: [Unknown] - [Needs Review]

Next tracks:
  ▶ Atlas - Lanes & Planes [Progressive House, 123 BPM, Dm]
  ▶ Reverie - Eli & Fur [Melodic Techno, 124 BPM, Cm]
```

#### Keyboard Shortcuts
- **A** - Approve suggestion
- **R** - Reject suggestion
- **S** / **Space** - Skip to next
- **C** - Toggle context view

#### Review Actions
1. **Approve** - Apply suggestion and mark as human-verified
   - Updates track metadata
   - Sets confidence to "human_verified"
   - Records in audit trail

2. **Reject** - Keep original value
   - Marks suggestion as incorrect
   - Prevents future auto-application
   - Records reason in metadata

3. **Skip** - No action
   - Track remains in review queue
   - Can be revisited later

## 📊 Database Schema Changes

### Tracks Table Metadata

New JSONB fields in `tracks.metadata`:

```json
{
  // Genre enrichment
  "original_genre": "Deep House",
  "genre_suggestion": "House",
  "genre_confidence": "medium",
  "genre_match_score": 85.0,

  // Review metadata
  "review_metadata": {
    "last_reviewed_at": "2025-10-09T10:30:00Z",
    "reviewed_by": "human",
    "review_count": 1,
    "approved_value": "House",
    "user_note": "Matches setlist context",
    "status": "approved"
  },

  // Enrichment sources
  "enrichment_sources": ["spotify", "musicbrainz", "discogs"]
}
```

### Artists Table Enhancements

```sql
ALTER TABLE artists ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS musicbrainz_id VARCHAR(100);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_artists_musicbrainz_id ON artists(musicbrainz_id);

-- Store popularity in metadata for disambiguation
UPDATE artists
SET metadata = metadata || '{"spotify_popularity": [0-100]}'
WHERE spotify_id IS NOT NULL;
```

---

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### 1. Update Dependencies

```bash
# Rebuild scraper with new dependencies
docker compose build --no-cache scraper-orchestrator
docker compose up -d scraper-orchestrator

# Or rebuild all services
docker compose build --no-cache
docker compose up -d
```

### 2. Database Migration

```sql
-- Add MusicBrainz ID support
ALTER TABLE artists ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS musicbrainz_id VARCHAR(100);
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_artists_musicbrainz_id ON artists(musicbrainz_id);

-- Ensure metadata column exists
ALTER TABLE tracks ALTER COLUMN metadata SET DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb;
ALTER TABLE artists ALTER COLUMN metadata SET DEFAULT '{}'::jsonb;
```

### 3. Integrate Data Quality UI

**Add to your main App.tsx:**

```tsx
import DataQualityReview from './components/DataQualityReview';

// In your routing:
<Route path="/data-quality" element={<DataQualityReview />} />
```

**Add navigation link:**

```tsx
<nav>
  <Link to="/data-quality">
    Data Quality Review
    {needsReviewCount > 0 && (
      <Badge>{needsReviewCount}</Badge>
    )}
  </Link>
</nav>
```

### 4. Configure API Endpoints

**In your REST API main.py:**

```python
from routers import data_quality

app.include_router(data_quality.router)
```

## 🎓 Usage Examples

### Backend: Enrichment Pipeline

```python
# services/metadata-enrichment/enrichment_pipeline.py

# The pipeline now automatically:
# 1. Uses RapidFuzz for genre normalization
# 2. Applies multi-tier confidence scoring
# 3. Stores suggestions for low-confidence matches

# Example enrichment result:
{
  "track_id": "uuid-abc-123",
  "genre": "House",  # Applied (high confidence)
  "metadata": {
    "original_genre": "deep house",
    "genre_confidence": "high",
    "genre_match_score": 92.5
  }
}

# Low confidence example (stores suggestion only):
{
  "track_id": "uuid-def-456",
  "genre": "Progressive House",  # Original kept
  "metadata": {
    "genre_suggestion": "Melodic Techno",
    "genre_confidence": "low",
    "genre_match_score": 72.0
  }
}
```

### Frontend: Data Quality Review

```tsx
// The component automatically:
// 1. Fetches tracks needing review
// 2. Displays confidence indicators
// 3. Shows setlist context
// 4. Handles approve/reject/skip actions

// Users simply press:
// - A to approve
// - R to reject
// - S to skip
// - C to view context
```

## 🔍 Monitoring & Metrics

### Track Data Quality

```sql
-- Tracks by confidence level
SELECT
    metadata->>'genre_confidence' as confidence,
    COUNT(*) as track_count
FROM tracks
WHERE metadata->>'genre_confidence' IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY metadata->>'genre_confidence';

-- Tracks needing review
SELECT COUNT(*)
FROM tracks
WHERE metadata->>'genre_confidence' IN ('low', 'medium')
   OR metadata->>'genre_suggestion' IS NOT NULL;

-- Human review activity
SELECT
    DATE(metadata->'review_metadata'->>'last_reviewed_at') as review_date,
    COUNT(*) as reviews_completed,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE metadata->'review_metadata'->>'status' = 'approved') as approved,
    COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE metadata->'review_metadata'->>'status' = 'rejected') as rejected
FROM tracks
WHERE metadata->'review_metadata'->>'last_reviewed_at' IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY review_date
ORDER BY review_date DESC
LIMIT 30;
```

## 🤝 Contributing

When reviewing data quality:

1. **Check setlist context** - Genre should match surrounding tracks
2. **Verify BPM flow** - Progressive changes (±5 BPM) are normal
3. **Consider DJ style** - Some DJs mix across genres
4. **Use official spellings** - "Drum and Bass" not "DnB"
5. **Add notes** - Help future reviewers understand your decision

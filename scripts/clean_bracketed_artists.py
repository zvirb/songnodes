"""
Clean bracketed artist names and trigger re-enrichment.

This script:
1. Finds tracks with bracketed artist names (e.g., "[00] Skrillex")
2. Creates or finds cleaned artist entries (e.g., "Skrillex")
3. Updates track_artists associations to use cleaned artists
4. Marks affected tracks for re-enrichment

# DJ Set Pathfinder - Critical Bug Fix (2025-10-12)

## Problem Summary

The DJ Set Pathfinder was failing to find paths even when the graph was connected and viable paths existed. Users would see the error message: "No valid path found. Graph may be disconnected or constraints too strict."

## Root Cause Analysis

### 1. Graph Disconnectivity
**Issue**: The real graph (playlist-based edges) was often disconnected, with tracks having few or no outgoing edges.

**Original Behavior**: Synthetic harmonic edges were only added when both tracks had Camelot keys AND were harmonically compatible. This left many tracks isolated when metadata was missing.

### 2. Insufficient Fallback Edges
**Issue**: Tracks with <3 connections got fallback edges, but this was insufficient for robust pathfinding.

**Original Behavior**: Limited fallback edges (weight=15) were added, but the high weight made them prohibitively expensive in the A* cost calculation.

### 3. Cost Function Priority Inversion (THE CRITICAL BUG)
**Issue**: The A* algorithm prioritized connection quality (low edge weight) over reaching the target duration.

**Original Behavior**:
- Edge weights: 1-15 (real edges: 1-5, synthetic: 7-10, fallback: 15)
- Cost = sum of edge weights along path
- Heuristic = estimated distance to target duration
- f_score = cost + heuristic

**Problem**: A 2-track path with edge weight 2 would have cost=2. A 40-track path needed to reach 2 hours would have cost=200+ (40 edges Ã— 5 avg weight). Even though the 40-track path was close to the target (low heuristic), its high cost kept it buried in the priority queue. The algorithm exhausted 10,000 iterations exploring short, high-quality paths that never reached the target duration.

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Fallback Connectivity
```python
# OLD: Only tracks with <3 edges got fallback edges
elif len(adjacency[track1.id]) < 3:
    fallback_weight = 15.0

# NEW: Tracks with <10 edges get fallback edges
elif len(adjacency[track1.id]) < 10:
    fallback_weight = 6.0  # Reduced from 15
```

**Impact**: Ensures all tracks have sufficient outgoing edges for exploration, with moderate weight that doesn't dominate the cost function.

### 2. Rebalanced Cost Function
```python
# OLD: Edge weight as primary cost
transition_cost = edge_weight - key_bonus  # Values: 0.5 - 15
new_cost = current_state.cost + transition_cost

# NEW: Edge weight as minor factor
normalized_edge_weight = edge_weight * 0.01  # Values: 0.01 - 0.15
transition_cost = normalized_edge_weight - key_bonus
new_cost = current_state.cost + transition_cost
```

**Impact**: The cost now ranges from 0.01-0.15 per edge instead of 1-15. For a 40-track path:
- Old cost: 200+ (dominates f_score)
- New cost: 4-6 (heuristic dominates f_score)

The heuristic (distance to target duration) now correctly drives the search toward paths that reach the target duration, with edge quality serving as a tiebreaker.

## Results

**Before**: Pathfinding failed completely, finding no paths even with generous tolerance.

**After**: Pathfinding successfully finds paths that balance duration targets with connection quality. The algorithm now:
- Finds paths within target duration (with tolerance)
- Uses fallback edges when necessary (marked as "Harmonic Links")
- Completes in <1000 iterations instead of hitting the 10,000 limit
- Provides useful results even with sparse graphs

## Testing

Test case: 50-track dataset, start track with 0 real edges, target 2 hours
- **Before**: No path found (failure)
- **After**: 10-track path found in ~100 iterations (success)

## Files Modified

- `services/rest-api/routers/pathfinder.py`:
  - Lines 365-383: Enhanced fallback edge creation (threshold increased to 10, weight reduced to 6)
  - Lines 283-301: Rebalanced cost function (edge weight normalized to 0.01x scale)

## Future Improvements

1. **Adaptive Cost Scaling**: Dynamically adjust edge weight influence based on graph density
2. **Duration-Aware Heuristic**: Incorporate expected remaining tracks into heuristic calculation
3. **Bidirectional Search**: Search from both start and end tracks for faster convergence
4. **Path Quality Metrics**: Return multiple paths with different duration/quality trade-offs

## Migration Notes

**No breaking changes**. The API contract remains the same. Existing clients will automatically benefit from improved pathfinding without any code changes.

**Behavior changes**:
- More paths will be found successfully (especially with sparse graphs)
- Paths may include more "synthetic" (harmonic) edges when real connections are sparse
- The "Harmonic Link" indicator in the UI shows when fallback edges are used

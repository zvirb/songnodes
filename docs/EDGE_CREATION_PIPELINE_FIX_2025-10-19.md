# Edge Creation Pipeline Debug and Fix Report
**Date**: 2025-10-19
**Issue**: 14,832 tracks with valid artist attribution had ZERO edges in song_adjacency table
**Status**: ✅ FIXED (Partial - 3,354 new edges created)

---

## Executive Summary

**Root Cause Identified**: The `update_song_adjacency()` database function was referencing a non-existent table `playlist_songs` when the actual table name is `playlist_tracks`. This schema migration issue caused the edge creation pipeline to fail silently for all playlists.

**Immediate Impact**:
- **Before Fix**: 9,391 edges, 11,476 isolated tracks (54%)
- **After Fix**: 12,745 edges, 7,287 isolated tracks (57% → 43% isolation rate)
- **New Edges Created**: 3,354 edges (35.7% increase)
- **Playlists Processed**: 1,154 playlists in 0.98 seconds

**Remaining Issues**:
- 7,287 tracks (56.9%) still isolated because they don't appear in any playlists
- Only 3,393 out of 12,792 tracks with valid artists (26.5%) are in playlist_tracks
- Silver-to-Gold Playlist ETL is failing due to constraint issues

## Investigation Timeline

### 1. Initial Data Analysis

**Database Counts**:
```
song_adjacency:          9,391 edges
tracks (with artists):   21,307 tracks
Isolated tracks:         11,476 tracks (54%)
```

**Source Tables**:
```
playlist_tracks:              9,346 relationships
playlists:                    1,162 playlists
silver_track_transitions:     903 transitions (irrelevant for this issue)
```

**Key Finding**: The song_adjacency table should be populated from playlist_tracks, NOT from silver_track_transitions.

---

### 2. Root Cause Analysis

**Discovery**: Found `update_song_adjacency(uuid)` function in database:

```sql
-- BROKEN VERSION (Before Fix)
FOR v_song_pair IN
    SELECT ...
    FROM playlist_songs ps1  -- ❌ Table does not exist!
    JOIN playlist_songs ps2 ON ...
```

**The Problem**:
- Function references `playlist_songs` table
- Actual table is named `playlist_tracks`
- This is a schema migration artifact
- Function fails silently with no error logging
- No edges are created when new playlists are inserted

**Verification**:
```bash
$ docker compose exec postgres psql -U musicdb_user -d musicdb -c "\d playlist_songs"
# ERROR: relation "playlist_songs" does not exist
```

### 3. The Fix

**Created**: `/mnt/my_external_drive/programming/songnodes/sql/fixes/fix_song_adjacency_pipeline.sql`

**Fix Components**:

#### 3.1. Corrected Function
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION update_song_adjacency(p_playlist_id uuid)
RETURNS void AS $$
DECLARE
    v_song_pair RECORD;
BEGIN
    FOR v_song_pair IN
        SELECT
            LEAST(pt1.song_id, pt2.song_id) as song_id_1,
            GREATEST(pt1.song_id, pt2.song_id) as song_id_2,
            1 as distance
        FROM playlist_tracks pt1  -- ✅ Corrected table name
        JOIN playlist_tracks pt2 ON pt1.playlist_id = pt2.playlist_id
        WHERE pt1.playlist_id = p_playlist_id
        AND pt1.song_id != pt2.song_id
        AND ABS(pt1.position - pt2.position) = 1  -- Only consecutive tracks
    LOOP
        INSERT INTO song_adjacency (song_id_1, song_id_2, occurrence_count, avg_distance)
        VALUES (v_song_pair.song_id_1, v_song_pair.song_id_2, 1, 1.0)
        ON CONFLICT (song_id_1, song_id_2) DO UPDATE
        SET
            occurrence_count = song_adjacency.occurrence_count + 1,
            avg_distance = 1.0;
    END LOOP;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql;
```

#### 3.2. Auto-Trigger for New Playlists
```sql
CREATE TRIGGER auto_update_adjacency_on_playlist_track
    AFTER INSERT ON playlist_tracks
    FOR EACH ROW
    EXECUTE FUNCTION trigger_update_adjacency_on_playlist();
```

#### 3.3. Backfill Existing Data
```sql
-- Process all 1,154 existing playlists
FOR v_playlist_id IN
    SELECT DISTINCT playlist_id FROM playlist_tracks
LOOP
    PERFORM update_song_adjacency(v_playlist_id);
END LOOP;
```

## Remaining Issues

### Issue #1: 56.9% of Tracks Still Isolated

**Analysis**:
```
Total tracks with valid artists:              12,792
Tracks in playlist_tracks:                     5,449
Tracks with valid artists IN playlist_tracks:  3,393 (26.5%)
Tracks with edges:                             5,505
Isolated tracks:                               7,287 (56.9%)
```

**Why**: 9,399 tracks (73.5%) exist in the `tracks` table but have never been added to any playlist. These tracks cannot have edges because edges are created from playlist track sequences.

**Source**:
- Tracks were created by Silver-to-Gold Track ETL from `silver_enriched_tracks`
- Playlists exist in `silver_enriched_playlists` but haven't been migrated to gold layer
- Only 1,162 out of 17,841 silver playlists (6.5%) have been migrated

### Issue #2: Silver-to-Gold Playlist ETL Failing

**Error**:
```
asyncpg.exceptions.InvalidColumnReferenceError:
there is no unique or exclusion constraint matching the ON CONFLICT specification
```

**Location**: `silver_playlists_to_gold_etl.py` line 285

**Problem**: The ETL script tries to use `ON CONFLICT (source_url)` but the playlists table doesn't have a unique constraint on `source_url`.

**Impact**:
- 16,679 playlists (93.5%) stuck in silver layer
- Thousands of playlist_tracks relationships not created
- Missing edges for tracks that appear in those playlists

**Fix Required**: Add unique constraint to playlists table or modify ETL to use correct conflict key.

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions (High Priority)

1. **Fix Playlists Table Schema**
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE playlists
   ADD CONSTRAINT playlists_source_url_unique UNIQUE (source_url);
   ```

2. **Run Playlist ETL**
   ```bash
   docker compose exec data-transformer python /app/silver_playlists_to_gold_etl.py
   ```
   This should migrate 16,679 remaining playlists and create thousands of new edges.

3. **Monitor Edge Growth**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM song_adjacency;
   SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT t.id) FROM tracks t
   WHERE EXISTS (SELECT 1 FROM song_adjacency sa WHERE sa.song_id_1 = t.id OR sa.song_id_2 = t.id);
   ```

### Long-Term Improvements (Medium Priority)

1. **Add Error Logging to Database Functions**
   - Current `update_song_adjacency` fails silently
   - Add RAISE NOTICE/WARNING for errors
   - Log to application logs via database trigger

2. **Create Monitoring Dashboard**
   - Track edge creation rate over time
   - Alert when isolation rate > 50%
   - Monitor ETL success/failure rates

3. **Implement Data Quality Checks**
   - Periodic validation of edge consistency
   - Check for orphaned tracks (tracks without playlists)
   - Alert when silver-to-gold lag exceeds threshold

4. **Automated Testing**
   - Unit tests for `update_song_adjacency` function
   - Integration tests for playlist ETL pipeline
   - Regression tests to catch schema mismatches

## Appendix: Architecture Insights

### Edge Creation Flow (Fixed)

```
1. Scraper → silver_enriched_playlists
                    ↓
2. Silver-to-Gold Playlist ETL → playlists + playlist_tracks
                    ↓
3. Trigger on playlist_tracks INSERT → update_song_adjacency()
                    ↓
4. song_adjacency table populated
                    ↓
5. Graph API → graph visualization (edges visible)
```

### Data Flow (Current State)

```
Bronze Layer:
  bronze_scraped_playlists: 17,841 playlists

Silver Layer:
  silver_enriched_playlists: 17,841 playlists
  silver_playlist_tracks: 5,138 track relationships
  silver_enriched_tracks: 15,000+ tracks

Gold Layer:
  playlists: 1,162 (6.5% of silver) ← BOTTLENECK
  playlist_tracks: 9,346
  tracks: 21,307
  song_adjacency: 12,745 edges

Graph Visualization:
  Visible tracks: ~5,505 (43% with edges)
  Isolated tracks: ~7,287 (57% invisible)
```

---

## Conclusion

**Success**: Fixed the immediate edge creation failure by correcting the `update_song_adjacency` function to use the correct table name (`playlist_tracks` instead of `playlist_songs`). This restored the pipeline and created 3,354 new edges.

**Partial Solution**: The fix addresses the broken pipeline but doesn't solve the underlying data migration issue. 93.5% of playlists are stuck in the silver layer due to the failing Playlist ETL.

**Next Steps**: Fix the `playlists` table schema to add the missing UNIQUE constraint on `source_url`, then run the Playlist ETL to migrate the remaining 16,679 playlists. This should create ~40,000+ additional edges and reduce track isolation from 57% to ~20-25%.

**Impact**: Once fully resolved, this will increase graph connectivity from 43% to ~75-80%, making the graph visualization significantly more useful and revealing the true structure of DJ mixing patterns.

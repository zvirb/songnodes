## Scraper Orchestrator Memory Issue

### Analysis

**Current Status**:
- Memory usage: 85.3%
- Threshold: 85%
- Actual container memory: 7.27% of host

**Root Cause**:
The healthcheck is reporting system-wide memory (82.5%) rather than container memory (7.27%). This is a **healthcheck configuration issue**, not an actual problem.

**Impact**:
- Service is **functionally healthy**
- Processing requests normally
- No actual memory pressure

**Recommendation**:
Update healthcheck to monitor container memory instead of system memory.

**Action Required**:
None immediate - cosmetic issue only.

---

## Raw Data Processor Activity

**Processing Status**: ‚úÖ Active
```
INFO:__main__:‚úì Processed scrape 1aff2985-2619-4e10-b835-68250fc807d0: {'tracks': 0, 'playlists': 1, 'edges': 0}
INFO:__main__:‚úì Processed scrape 0f617646-f8d1-4208-b0dd-50b97f8cbc39: {'tracks': 0, 'playlists': 1, 'edges': 0}
```

Successfully processing scrapes from the queue.

## Post-Deployment Actions

### Immediate (Completed)

- ‚úÖ Verify all services healthy
- ‚úÖ Check API endpoints responding
- ‚úÖ Verify frontend loads
- ‚úÖ Confirm data processing active

### Monitoring (Ongoing)

- Monitor scraper-orchestrator memory (cosmetic issue)
- Watch for any unexpected errors in logs
- Verify continued data processing

### Future (Optional)

- Update scraper-orchestrator healthcheck to use container memory
- Consider increasing memory threshold to 90%
- Review legacy scraper files for potential deletion

---

## Rollback Plan

**If issues arise**:

1. **Quick Rollback**:
   ```bash
   git revert 2ca1762
   docker compose build metadata-enrichment raw-data-processor scraper-orchestrator
   docker compose up -d
   ```

2. **Full Rollback**:
   ```bash
   git reset --hard f25a7b4  # Previous commit
   git push --force origin main
   docker compose down
   docker compose up -d --build
   ```

**Risk Assessment**: ‚¨áÔ∏è **LOW**
- Only docstrings and comments modified
- No logic changes
- All services tested and verified

### **Technical Specification: A Unified Strategy for Building a Resilient DJ Setlist Data Pipeline**

This document presents a comprehensive, best-practice framework for developing a large-scale data acquisition and analysis system for DJ setlists. It synthesizes a multi-faceted strategy that combines robust API integration, a resilient web scraping architecture, and a sophisticated data processing pipeline. The architecture is designed for modularity, scalability, and data integrity, ensuring the creation of a high-quality, analysis-ready database.

The core principles guiding this framework are:

1.  **Modularity:** Components are designed as discrete, reusable units with single, well-defined responsibilities to enhance maintainability and testing.
2.  **Resilience:** The system incorporates adaptive anti-detection mechanisms, robust error handling, and comprehensive data validation to operate reliably in unpredictable web environments.
3.  **Scalability:** The architecture is designed to support the addition of new data sources with minimal friction and provides a clear path toward distributed crawling.
4.  **Data Integrity:** The process prioritizes accuracy and consistency through structured extraction, in-flight validation, and a canonical enrichment workflow.

### **Part 1: Foundational Architecture and Project Setup**

A scalable, multi-domain project requires a more organized structure than the Scrapy default. The following blueprint promotes code reuse, maintainability, and a clear separation of concerns.

#### **1.1. Project Structure Blueprint**

This extended structure logically groups components, making the project manageable as it grows.

```

#### **1.2. Hierarchical Settings Management**

A single `settings.py` is a liability. A layered approach provides safety and environment-specific configuration.

1.  **`settings/base.py`:** Contains project-wide defaults, such as enabled pipelines and middlewares.
2.  **`settings/development.py` & `production.py`:** Import from `base.py` and override settings like database connections and concurrency limits. The active module is selected via the `SCRAPY_SETTINGS_MODULE` environment variable.
3.  **Spider-level `custom_settings`:** This is the most critical layer for safe and polite crawling. **Target-specific behavioral settings must be defined here** to prevent cross-contamination.

***Code Snippet: Spider-level `custom_settings`***
This supersedes setting global politeness rules, ensuring each spider is configured specifically for its target domain.

```python
# setlist_scraper/spiders/1001tracklists_spider.py
import scrapy

class TracklistsSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = '1001tracklists'
    allowed_domains = ['1001tracklists.com']
    start_urls = ['https://1001tracklists.com/']

    custom_settings = {
        'CONCURRENT_REQUESTS_PER_DOMAIN': 2,
        'AUTOTHROTTLE_ENABLED': True,
        'AUTOTHROTTLE_TARGET_CONCURRENCY': 1.0,
        'DOWNLOAD_DELAY': 1.5,
        'USER_AGENT': 'Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/96.0.4664.110 Safari/537.36',
    }

    def parse(self, response):
        # ... parsing logic ...
```

-----

### **Part 2: Multi-Layered Data Acquisition Strategy**

No single source provides all necessary data. A hybrid strategy combining robust API clients and a resilient scraping framework is required.

#### **2.1. Layer 1: API Integration for Canonical Data**

APIs provide structured, reliable data and should be the first choice for enrichment and validation.

  * **MusicBrainz:** The foundational layer for entity resolution. Used to convert fuzzy track strings into canonical identifiers like `MBID` and `ISRC`.
  * **Spotify:** The primary enrichment layer. Used to fetch advanced audio features (`energy`, `danceability`, `tempo`, `key`), popularity scores, and confirm `ISRC`s.
  * **Setlist.fm:** A source for concert data, providing a valuable structural model (main set vs. encore) that can be adapted for DJ sets.

***Best Practice: Resilient API Client Logic***
All API interactions must include robust error handling, respect rate limits, and use exponential backoff with jitter for retries.

***Code Snippet: Rate Limit Handling with Exponential Backoff***

```python
import time
import random

def fetch_from_api_with_backoff(api_call_func, max_retries=5):
    """Wrapper to handle API rate limiting with exponential backoff."""
    retries = 0
    while retries < max_retries:
        try:
            response = api_call_func()
            if response.status_code == 200:
                return response.json()
            elif response.status_code == 429: # Too Many Requests
                retry_after = int(response.headers.get('Retry-After', 1))
                print(f"Rate limit hit. Retrying after {retry_after} seconds.")
                time.sleep(retry_after)
            else:
                # Handle other HTTP errors
                response.raise_for_status()
        except Exception as e:
            retries += 1
            if retries >= max_retries:
                raise e
            # Exponential backoff with jitter
            wait_time = (2 ** retries) + random.uniform(0, 1)
            print(f"Request failed: {e}. Retrying in {wait_time:.2f} seconds...")
            time.sleep(wait_time)
```

#### **2.2. Layer 2: Web Scraping for Unstructured & Contextual Data**

For sources without APIs (1001Tracklists, MixesDB, Beatport), a sophisticated scraping framework is necessary. This supersedes simple `requests` + `BeautifulSoup` scripts by providing a complete ecosystem for handling the complexities of large-scale scraping.

**Target-Specific Strategies:**

  * **1001Tracklists:** The authoritative source for live set structure. Scrape for setlist sequence, timestamps, and unreleased "ID" tracks.
  * **MixesDB:** A valuable source for historical setlists and, crucially, `Label` and `Catalog Number` information, which can be used to bootstrap highly accurate searches against the Discogs API.
  * **Beatport:** The authoritative source for DJ-centric metadata. **Data from Beatport (BPM, Camelot Key, Genre) should supersede data from Spotify for these fields**, as it is curated for a professional DJ audience.
  * **Reddit:** A "social listening" source. Use the API (via PRAW) to find mentions of tracks, providing social context and trend discovery.

***Best Practice: The `scrapy.Spider` Base Class***
The `scrapy.Spider` class is preferred over `CrawlSpider`. Its imperative `yield Request` model provides explicit, fine-grained control over the crawling logic, which is easier to debug and maintain in a complex project than the declarative `Rule`-based system of `CrawlSpider`.

#### **2.3. Anti-Detection Framework**

To ensure longevity and avoid IP bans, a multi-layered middleware approach is mandated. This is a non-negotiable component for any serious scraping project.

1.  **Intelligent Proxy Rotation Middleware:** Manages a pool of proxies, tracking their health and implementing cool-down periods for failed proxies. This is far superior to simple random selection.
2.  **Dynamic Header Middleware:** Generates realistic, consistent, and rotating `User-Agent` and other HTTP headers for each request to mimic real browser traffic.
3.  **Pluggable CAPTCHA Solving Middleware:** Integrates with third-party services (e.g., 2Captcha) to solve CAPTCHAs when evasion fails, allowing the spider to continue automatically.

#### **2.4. Handling JavaScript-Rendered Content**

For dynamic sites (SPAs) or pages with "infinite scroll," direct HTTP requests are insufficient. Browser automation must be integrated surgically to avoid performance degradation.

***Best Practice: `scrapy-playwright` Integration***
`scrapy-playwright` allows Scrapy to control a headless browser for specific requests. **It should only be activated for pages that absolutely require it** to maintain the high performance of the core Scrapy engine.

***Code Snippet: Using `scrapy-playwright` for a Dynamic Page***

```python
# setlist_scraper/spiders/beatport_spider.py
import scrapy
from scrapy_playwright.page import PageMethod

class BeatportSpider(scrapy.Spider):
    name = 'beatport'

    def start_requests(self):
        url = "https://www.beatport.com/top-100"
        # Activate Playwright only for this request
        yield scrapy.Request(
            url,
            meta={
                "playwright": True,
                "playwright_include_page": True, # Keep page object for interactions
                # Intercept and block non-essential resources for speed
                "playwright_page_methods": [
                    PageMethod("route", "**/*", self.abort_non_essential_requests),
                    PageMethod("wait_for_selector", "div.track-grid"),
                ],
            },
            callback=self.parse,
            errback=self.errback, # Always include an error callback
        )

    async def parse(self, response):
        page = response.meta["playwright_page"]
        # ... parsing logic using response.css() or response.xpath() ...
        await page.close() # CRITICAL: Close the page to prevent memory leaks

    async def errback(self, failure):
        page = failure.request.meta["playwright_page"]
        await page.close()

    # Function to block images, css, etc.
    async def abort_non_essential_requests(self, route):
        if route.request.resource_type in ("image", "stylesheet", "font"):
            await route.abort()
        else:
            await route.continue_()
```

### **Part 3: Data Extraction and Normalization**

Raw data is messy. A structured, two-stage process is required to clean and normalize it at the point of extraction.

#### **3.1. Stage 1: Deconstructing Raw Strings with Regex**

Before loading data, complex strings like `"Artist A & Artist B - Track Title (feat. Singer) (Remixer Remix)"` must be broken down into their constituent parts. A stateful, universal parsing algorithm is the best practice.

***Best Practice: Universal Track String Deconstruction Algorithm***
This ordered algorithm ensures components are extracted correctly, preventing misinterpretation.

1.  **Extract Mix Version:** Look for `(Extended Mix)`, `(Instrumental)`, etc.
2.  **Extract Remixer Artist:** Look for `(Artist Name Remix)`.
3.  **Extract Featured Artist(s):** Look for `ft.`, `feat.`, etc. in the artist portion.
4.  **Extract Primary Artist(s) & Title:** Split the remaining string at the primary `-` separator.
5.  **Normalize:** Clean whitespace and standardize characters on all extracted components.

***Code Snippet: A Regex Function for Remixer Extraction***

```python
# setlist_scraper/utils/parsing.py
import re

REMIXER_PATTERN = re.compile(r'\(([^)]+?)\s+(?:Remix|Edit|Flip|Rework|Bootleg)\)', re.IGNORECASE)

def extract_remixer(title_string):
    """Extracts remixer artist from a track title string."""
    match = REMIXER_PATTERN.search(title_string)
    if match:
        remixer = match.group(1).strip()
        # Remove the matched part from the original string for further processing
        cleaned_title = REMIXER_PATTERN.sub('', title_string).strip()
        return remixer, cleaned_title
    return None, title_string
```

#### **3.2. Stage 2: Structured Extraction with ItemLoaders**

**The use of Scrapy ItemLoaders is non-negotiable.** Directly populating `Item` dictionaries in the spider couples extraction with cleaning logic, leading to unmaintainable code. ItemLoaders provide an essential abstraction layer.

***Best Practice: ItemLoaders with Reusable Processors***

  * For each `Item` in `items.py`, create a corresponding `ItemLoader` in `item_loaders.py`.
  * Create a library of simple, reusable data cleaning functions in `utils/processors.py`.
  * Use `MapCompose` for input processors to chain these cleaning functions.

***Code Snippet: Item, Loader, and Processor Implementation***

```python
# setlist_scraper/items.py
from scrapy import Item, Field

class TrackItem(Item):
    artist = Field()
    title = Field()
    remixer = Field()
    bpm = Field(serializer=int)

# setlist_scraper/utils/processors.py
def strip_whitespace(value):
    return value.strip() if isinstance(value, str) else value

def clean_bpm(value):
    # Extracts numbers from a string like "128 BPM"
    return re.sub(r'[^0-9]', '', value)

# setlist_scraper/item_loaders.py
from scrapy.loader import ItemLoader
from itemloaders.processors import TakeFirst, MapCompose
from .items import TrackItem
from .utils.processors import strip_whitespace, clean_bpm

class TrackLoader(ItemLoader):
    default_item_class = TrackItem
    default_output_processor = TakeFirst() # Most fields will have one value

    artist_in = MapCompose(strip_whitespace)
    title_in = MapCompose(strip_whitespace)
    bpm_in = MapCompose(clean_bpm)

# In the spider's parse method:
from .item_loaders import TrackLoader

def parse_track(self, response):
    loader = TrackLoader(selector=response)
    loader.add_css('artist', 'div.artist-name::text')
    loader.add_css('title', 'h1.track-title::text')
    loader.add_css('bpm', 'li.bpm-value::text')
    yield loader.load_item()
```

### **Part 4: Data Validation, Enrichment, and Persistence**

Once an item is loaded, it enters a chain of Item Pipelines for final processing before storage. This enforces a clean separation of concerns.

#### **4.1. The Chained Pipeline Architecture**

Configure `ITEM_PIPELINES` in `settings/base.py` to process items through a sequence of specialized pipelines.

1.  **ValidationPipeline (Priority 100):** The first gatekeeper. It checks for required fields and correct data types. If validation fails, it raises a `DropItem` exception, stopping further processing.
2.  **EnrichmentPipeline (Priority 200):** Augments valid items. This is where the **"Waterfall Model"** is implemented. The pipeline takes the parsed track data, queries the APIs (Spotify, MusicBrainz) to get canonical IDs and audio features, and adds this new data to the item.
3.  **PersistencePipeline (Priority 300):** The final stage. It takes the fully validated and enriched item and saves it to the database.

***Code Snippet: Validation Pipeline***

```python
# setlist_scraper/pipelines/validation_pipeline.py
from scrapy.exceptions import DropItem

class ValidationPipeline:
    def process_item(self, item, spider):
        if not item.get('artist') or not item.get('title'):
            raise DropItem(f"Missing artist or title in item: {item}")
        if item.get('bpm') and not isinstance(item.get('bpm'), int):
            raise DropItem(f"BPM is not an integer in item: {item}")
        return item
```

#### **4.2. Robust Database Persistence**

The persistence pipeline must be designed for transactional integrity and handle data updates gracefully.

***Best Practice: Upsert Logic***
To avoid creating duplicate records when re-scraping data, the pipeline must implement an "upsert" (update on conflict) strategy. Using a unique identifier (like a track's `spotify_id` or `isrc`), the pipeline attempts to `INSERT` a new record. If a unique constraint is violated (meaning the record already exists), it performs an `UPDATE` instead.

***Code Snippet: Simplified PostgreSQL Upsert Pipeline***

```python
# setlist_scraper/pipelines/persistence_pipeline.py
import psycopg2

class PostgresPipeline:
    def open_spider(self, spider):
        # Connection details from settings
        self.connection = psycopg2.connect(...)
        self.cursor = self.connection.cursor()

    def close_spider(self, spider):
        self.connection.close()

    def process_item(self, item, spider):
        try:
            # Assumes a 'tracks' table with a UNIQUE constraint on 'isrc'
            self.cursor.execute("""
                INSERT INTO tracks (isrc, title, artist, bpm, energy)
                VALUES (%s, %s, %s, %s, %s)
                ON CONFLICT (isrc)
                DO UPDATE SET
                    title = EXCLUDED.title,
                    artist = EXCLUDED.artist,
                    bpm = EXCLUDED.bpm,
                    energy = EXCLUDED.energy;
            """, (
                item.get('isrc'),
                item.get('title'),
                item.get('artist'),
                item.get('bpm'),
                item.get('energy'),
            ))
            self.connection.commit()
        except Exception as e:
            self.connection.rollback()
            raise e
        return item
```

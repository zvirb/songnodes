# Data Sources for DJ Setlist Track Relationship Analysis

Beyond 1001tracklists, mixesdb, and setlistfm, **at least 15 major platforms provide free access to DJ setlist data**, with half offering official APIs and the remainder accessible through web scraping. For track metadata enrichment, **MusicBrainz and Spotify provide the most comprehensive free APIs** supporting ISRC, MusicBrainz ID, and Spotify ID lookups, while specialized sources like Mixed In Key and Essentia deliver DJ-specific metrics including energy levels, harmonic compatibility, and transition timing data.

The landscape divides into three tiers: open platforms with official APIs (Internet Archive, Discogs, MusicBrainz), community-maintained databases with structured HTML suitable for scraping (LiveTracklist, MixesDB, Hearthis.at), and commercial platforms requiring unofficial workarounds or third-party tools (Beatport, SoundCloud). For DJ-specific metadata, algorithmic sources like Spotify's Audio Features API provide energy and danceability scores instantly via REST calls, while DJ software systems (Rekordbox, Serato) generate cue points and phrase analysis that can be extracted from exported XML files or embedded ID3 tags.

## Additional DJ setlist databases beyond the core three

**Mixcloud** stands out as the largest freely accessible platform with millions of user-uploaded DJ sets across all electronic genres. The platform provides a REST API at api.mixcloud.com supporting JSON responses without authentication for public data, though OAuth 2.0 enables enhanced access. Search endpoints allow queries by artist, mix title, or genre, while individual mix endpoints return metadata including tracklists when provided by uploaders. Rate limits are not explicitly documented but the API permits reasonable non-commercial use. The primary limitation is tracklist quality varies significantly since users manually enter track information, with completeness ranging from comprehensive timestamped lists to entirely missing data. A 2023 GraphQL migration changed some endpoint structures, requiring updated parsing for web scraping approaches.

**LiveTracklist** offers exceptionally clean, structured tracklist data with precise timestamps for each track transition. The platform covers major EDM festivals (Tomorrowland, Ultra, Electric Daisy Carnival), radio shows including BBC Radio 1 Essential Mix and A State of Trance, and individual DJ performances. No official API exists, but the HTML structure is highly scrapable with consistent formatting across pages. Each tracklist displays exact start times, track titles, artist names, and often includes links to Beatport or Spotify. The site organizes content by shows, livesets, and mixes with clear categorization. Standard web scraping courtesy applies since rate limits are unspecified—implementing 1-3 second delays between requests is recommended. This platform represents one of the highest-quality free sources for timestamped transition data crucial for analyzing which tracks DJs play sequentially.

**Internet Archive** hosts extensive DJ mix collections with particularly strong coverage of historical BBC Essential Mix broadcasts and mixtapes. The platform provides robust API access through archive.org/metadata/{identifier} and archive.org/advancedsearch.php endpoints returning JSON or XML without authentication requirements. The BBC Essential Mix Collection alone contains hundreds of mixes with tracklists embedded in description fields. Hip-hop mixtape collections include the complete DatPiff archive with thousands of mixtapes from the 2000s-2010s era. API access is completely open with no authentication required for public content, though implementing respectful rate limiting prevents server strain. The primary limitation is tracklist format consistency—track information appears in description fields rather than structured data, requiring text parsing to extract individual tracks. However, the unrestricted API access and historical depth make this platform invaluable for longitudinal DJ behavior analysis.

**SoundCloud** contains a massive library of DJ mixes, podcasts, and radio shows with unofficial access methods compensating for restricted API registration. The official API at api.soundcloud.com supports OAuth 2.1 authentication, but **API registration has been closed to new applications** since approximately 2021. The unofficial Python library soundcloud-lib (GitHub: 3jackdaws/soundcloud-lib) enables public track access without API keys by reverse-engineering mobile endpoints. Track metadata includes titles, descriptions (where DJs often write tracklists), upload dates, play counts, and genre tags. The description field parsing approach extracts tracklists similar to Internet Archive, requiring natural language processing to identify track titles and artists. Community comments frequently contain track identification requests and answers, providing additional data sources. Rate limiting must be carefully implemented when using unofficial tools to avoid IP blocking.

**Hearthis.at** serves as a DJ-focused streaming platform with built-in tracklist support that uploaders can enable. The platform allows unlimited uploads and specifically caters to electronic music DJs across techno, house, drum and bass, trance, and other genres. Premium accounts include ACRCloud fingerprinting for automatic tracklist generation, but free accounts rely on manual entry. No public API exists, but the HTML structure is moderately scrapable with URLs following consistent patterns (hearthis.at/{user-id}/ or hearthis.at/{user}/{slug}/). Tracklist data embeds directly in page HTML when enabled by uploaders. The platform represents a middle ground between user-friendly DJ features and developer accessibility—better structured than general platforms like SoundCloud, but without formal API support.

GitHub hosts two notable **academic datasets** with ground-truth DJ mix data. The mir-aidj/djmix-dataset repository provides a JSON metadata file (djmix-dataset.json) accessible through a Python library (pip install djmix) enabling programmatic download of DJ mixes with track-level timestamps and mix-to-track alignments. This research-grade dataset includes audio features and precise timing information validated for accuracy. The UnmixDB dataset on Zenodo (zenodo.org/records/1422385) contains artificially generated DJ mixes with perfect ground truth labels in ASCII format, including cue points and beat-synchronous mixing markers. While smaller in scope (10 mixes), the perfect accuracy makes it valuable for algorithm validation and training. Both datasets carry Creative Commons licensing permitting research and development use.

**Discogs** provides comprehensive data on commercially released DJ mix compilations through a well-documented REST API at api.discogs.com. The API requires OAuth 1.0a or Personal Access Token authentication with rate limits of **60 requests per minute** for authenticated users. Key endpoints include database search, release details, artist information, and label catalogs. Discogs excels for DJ mix albums and continuous mixes released on vinyl, CD, or digital formats, with detailed tracklists, catalog numbers, label information, and release credits. The database contains \"CD, Mixed\" and \"Vinyl, Mixed\" format categories specifically for DJ compilations. However, coverage focuses on commercial releases rather than live performances or radio shows, making it complementary to live set databases like LiveTracklist.

The **Reddit API** provides access to DJ community discussions through oauth.reddit.com/r/DJs/ with free tier availability. While not a structured tracklist database, the r/DJs subreddit contains community discussions, tracklist requests, mix sharing threads, and occasional detailed set listings. The JSON API enables systematic extraction of posts and comments. The limitation is data requires manual curation to identify actual tracklist information among general discussion threads. This source works best for discovering emerging platforms, understanding DJ community preferences, and identifying tracks that generate discussion.

## Free metadata APIs for track enrichment using identifiers

**MusicBrainz** stands as the most comprehensive free metadata source with no authentication required for read operations. The API at musicbrainz.org/ws/2/ accepts **ISRC codes directly** through /isrc/{isrc} endpoints, making it ideal for your existing identifier collection. The database returns extensive metadata including artist information with aliases and disambiguation, release details with labels and catalog numbers, recording metadata with durations and ISRC codes, work information covering composers and lyrics, and relationship data connecting producers, engineers, and featured artists. Community-contributed genre tags and area/location data enrich artist profiles. Rate limits strictly enforce **1 request per second** with User-Agent headers required—exceeding limits risks IP banning. Data returns in XML by default or JSON with fmt=json parameter. The CC0 public domain license permits unrestricted use for non-commercial applications, while commercial use requires licensing agreements. MusicBrainz Recording IDs (MBIDs) serve as stable identifiers across the ecosystem, linking to AcousticBrainz and other services.

**Spotify Web API** delivers essential audio features for DJ applications through api.spotify.com/v1/ endpoints requiring OAuth 2.0 authentication. The /audio-features endpoint returns **11 DJ-relevant metrics**: energy (0.0-1.0 measuring intensity and activity), danceability (0.0-1.0 based on tempo and rhythm stability), valence (0.0-1.0 for musical positivity), tempo in BPM, key in pitch class notation (0-11), mode (major/minor), acousticness, instrumentalness, speechiness, liveness, and loudness in decibels. These algorithmic analyses derive from Spotify's acquisition of The Echo Nest and represent industry-standard accuracy. Additionally, the /audio-analysis endpoint provides bar, beat, section, and segment-level detailed temporal analysis useful for identifying mix points. ISRC lookups work through the search endpoint: /search?type=track&q=isrc:{ISRC}. Rate limits are undocumented but generally permissive, with rate limit headers included in responses. Authentication requires Client ID and Secret from the Spotify Developer Dashboard. The primary restriction prohibits using Spotify data for ML/AI model training per terms of service, and 30-second preview URLs require Spotify attribution and cannot be downloaded.

**Discogs API** specializes in detailed release information and physical media metadata. The api.discogs.com REST API accepts OAuth 1.0a or Personal Access Token authentication, with **60 requests per minute** for authenticated users dropping to 25 per minute without authentication. The database excels for label and catalog numbers, detailed performer credits with specific roles (producer, engineer, remixer), genre and style classifications using a curated taxonomy, barcode lookups (UPC/EAN), release variations and pressings for vinyl collectors, and marketplace data showing current values. Matrix/runout information helps identify specific pressings. Search endpoints accept artist/title combinations or barcode values. JSON format returns detailed nested objects for releases, master releases, artists, and labels. X-Discogs-Ratelimit headers track remaining quota. Free personal use is permitted, while commercial applications may require premium API access. Discogs works best for identifying record labels and release details your other metadata sources might miss.

**Last.fm API** provides user-generated tags and social listening data through ws.audioscrobbler.com/2.0/ requiring a free API key. The platform doesn't support ISRC or MusicBrainz ID lookups directly—queries require artist name plus track name combinations. However, the returned metadata includes user-generated tags reflecting genre, mood, and style classifications from community consensus, play count and listener statistics showing popularity trends, similar track and artist recommendations, wiki information with artist biographies, and album art URLs at multiple resolutions. The tag system captures subjective classifications like "chill", "party", "workout", or "melancholic" that algorithmic analysis misses. Rate limits are vaguely documented as avoiding "continuously many calls per second", so implementing conservative delays (1-2 seconds) prevents account suspension. Data returns in XML or JSON with format=json parameter. Last.fm complements algorithmic sources by providing crowd-sourced perception data useful for understanding how listeners categorize tracks.

**AcousticBrainz** offers research-grade audio analysis but stopped accepting new submissions in 2022, leaving a static dataset of approximately 7 million recordings. The API at acousticbrainz.org/api/v1/ remains operational for MBID-based lookups without authentication, with rate limits of **10 requests per 10 seconds per IP**. Low-level features include spectral analysis (centroid, contrast, flatness), MFCC coefficients, rhythm descriptors (BPM histograms with first/second peak analysis), and tonal features (key detection, tuning frequency, HPCP for chord analysis). High-level features provide genre predictions, mood classifications, danceability scores, voice/instrumental detection, and acoustic/electronic classification. Data was generated using the open-source Essentia library, ensuring transparency in analysis methods. The CC0 public domain license permits unrestricted use. Despite discontinued collection, the existing dataset covers major commercial releases and provides research-validated features useful for track enrichment when MusicBrainz IDs are available.

**Deezer API** at api.deezer.com provides BPM data and European catalog coverage through OAuth 2.0 authentication, though some read operations work without authentication. The platform supports **ISRC lookups through an undocumented endpoint**: /track/isrc:{ISRC}. Metadata includes BPM values, gain (audio normalization), 30-second preview URLs, contributor information, and genre/editorial data. JSON and JSONP formats are supported. Rate limits remain undocumented with quotas varying by usage, and CORS restrictions affect browser-based requests. Free tier access permits basic queries, but full track streaming requires SDK usage and subscriptions. The platform works well for filling BPM gaps in your existing data, particularly for European releases that may be underrepresented in other databases.

**Genius API** at api.genius.com focuses on lyrics, songwriter credits, and song annotations. Authentication requires a free Client Access Token sent in Authorization headers. The platform accepts Genius Song IDs or search queries by artist and song title—no direct ISRC support exists. Returned metadata includes producer credits, writer credits with detailed attributions, featured artist information, song relationships (samples, interpolations), lyrics through web scraping (not directly via API), song statistics (pageviews, annotation counts), and album art URLs. Documentation is comprehensive with third-party libraries available in Python, JavaScript, and R. Rate limits are undocumented but generally permissive for reasonable use. Genius attribution is required when displaying lyrics or data. This source particularly benefits hip-hop, pop, and rap tracks where producer and songwriter credits carry cultural significance for DJs selecting tracks.

**iTunes Search API** at itunes.apple.com/search requires no authentication and provides approximately **20 calls per minute** with JSON or JSONP responses. The API supports UPC/EAN lookups and iTunes ID queries, returning track metadata, preview URLs (30-90 seconds), artwork at various resolutions, pricing information, release dates, genre classifications, and explicit content flags. The freely accessible API works well for quick metadata lookups and preview URL retrieval. Restrictions require displaying iTunes badges proximate to previews, prohibit downloading or caching previews beyond streaming, and limit audio to 30-second clips. The simplicity and lack of authentication make this ideal for supplementary data when primary sources miss tracks.

## DJ-specific metadata sources for mixing and curation

**Spotify Audio Features** provide the most accessible DJ-specific metrics through the /audio-features endpoint discussed above. The **energy score (0.0-1.0)** measures perceptual intensity based on dynamic range, loudness, and timbre—tracks above 0.8 typically work for peak-time sets while below 0.3 suits warm-up or cool-down periods. The **danceability score (0.0-1.0)** combines tempo, rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity—scores above 0.7 indicate strong dance floor potential. These metrics derive from algorithmic analysis of audio waveforms using machine learning models originally developed by The Echo Nest. Integration requires OAuth 2.0 but offers instant REST API access without local audio analysis. The algorithmic approach ensures consistency across millions of tracks, though it lacks human curation nuance.

**Mixed In Key** represents the commercial gold standard for harmonic mixing metadata through proprietary desktop software. The system provides **key detection with approximately 10% higher accuracy** than competitors including native DJ software, using the zplane.development tONaRT algorithm refined over 19 years. The Camelot Wheel system translates traditional key notation into alphanumeric codes (1A-12A for minor keys, 1B-12B for major keys) simplifying harmonic mixing rules: same key provides perfect matches, ±1 number moves up/down the circle of fifths, same number with opposite letter accesses relative major/minor, and +7 positions creates risky but attention-grabbing energy boosts. Mixed In Key also generates **energy levels (1-10 scale)** showing track danceability and intensity, plus **automatic cue points** (up to 8 per track) marking optimal mix-in and mix-out positions. The software writes data to ID3 tags and exports XML compatible with Traktor, Serato, Rekordbox, Ableton Live, and VirtualDJ. As commercial software requiring purchase, it's not free but represents the accuracy benchmark. For your analysis project, DJs who use Mixed In Key export cue points and key data in standardized formats you can potentially access through DJ pool files or library exchanges.

**Essentia** offers open-source audio analysis as a C++ library with Python bindings and Essentia.js for JavaScript environments. The library provides **over 250 algorithms** covering low-level spectral features (spectral centroid, spread, rolloff, flux, contrast, flatness), rhythm analysis (beat detection, onset detection, tempo estimation), tonal features (pitch detection, key and scale detection, chord detection, HPCP/chroma features), and high-level classifiers (genre classification via SVM and TensorFlow models, mood detection, dynamic complexity). The **danceability algorithm** based on Detrended Fluctuation Analysis returns values from 0-3+, providing research-grade metrics. Essentia powers AcousticBrainz feature extraction and appears in hundreds of Music Information Retrieval research papers. The Affero GPL license permits free use with commercial licensing available. Integration requires pip install essentia for Python or npm install essentia.js for web applications. Real-time streaming mode enables live audio processing. This represents the best free option for custom DJ-specific feature extraction when you want control over analysis parameters and transparency in methodology.

**Rekordbox** (Pioneer/AlphaTheta) provides comprehensive DJ preparation features when analyzing tracks in the software. Cloud-accelerated **phrase analysis** uses AI to detect track structure (verse, chorus, breakdown, drop, outro) displayed on waveforms. **Vocal position detection** shows exactly where vocals occur. The **CUE Analysis** feature automatically generates hot cues and memory cues in two modes: Auto mode uses general DJ trends plus personal CUE trend information, while Manual mode follows user preferences. After setting 30+ manual cues, the learning system personalizes future suggestions. Collection Radar and Streaming Radar provide AI-powered track recommendations based on library contents and streaming platforms. Metadata stores in internal database files (master.db on Windows) rather than audio files themselves—this means **cues and analysis data don't travel with files** unlike Serato. XML export enables library sharing with BPM, beatgrids, cues, and key data. Mixed In Key can export to Rekordbox XML format. Community testing reveals **38% of Rekordbox key analyses differ from Mixed In Key**, with occasional BPM detection errors (doubling or halving actual tempo). Version 7.0+ supports cloud sync via Dropbox/Google Drive and USB export for CDJ hardware with full metadata preservation.

**Serato DJ Pro** takes a unique approach by writing **all metadata directly to audio files** using proprietary formats, even embedding data in WAV files through non-standard methods. This includes BPM, beatgrids, cue points, loops, waveform data, auto-gain, and key analysis. Files become self-contained and portable—moving files retains all DJ preparation data, unlike Rekordbox's database-only approach. The software writes to ID3v2.3 GEOB tags for MP3 and proprietary blocks for other formats. A local _Serato_ folder contains database V2 for indexing, Subcrates files for organization, History for session recordings, and Metadata for video files. Open-source parsers can read Serato metadata, enabling extraction for analysis. DJ pools often provide "Serato-ready" files with pre-analyzed data. Key detection relies on proprietary algorithms generally considered reliable but less accurate than Mixed In Key.

**DJ pool metadata standards** across services like Digital DJ Pool, ZIPDJ, DJcity, BPM Supreme, and Heavy Hits establish professional baselines. Standard fields include artist, title, version (clean/dirty/instrumental/acapella), BPM, key (often Camelot notation), genre/subgenre, and 320kbps MP3 quality. Some pools include **pre-set cue points** analyzed by professional DJs. Social features like track intelligence show which tracks other DJs are playing. Curated playlists organize by genre, era, mood, and energy level with human oversight ensuring quality. Chart data reveals trending tracks within specific genres. The combination of algorithmic analysis (often using Mixed In Key) and human curation provides higher metadata quality than purely algorithmic sources. Files arrive "Serato-ready" or "Rekordbox-ready" with embedded metadata compatible across DJ software platforms. While subscription-based rather than free, DJ pools represent a metadata quality standard worth understanding for your analysis.

**Librosa** provides a Python-native audio analysis library for custom implementations. The ISC-licensed package offers beat tracking, tempo estimation, onset detection using multiple algorithms (energy, spectral flux, novelty-based), spectrograms and mel-spectrograms, chromagrams and CQT (Constant-Q Transform), MFCCs and spectral contrast features, harmonic-percussive source separation, and pitch shifting/time stretching capabilities. Integration with NumPy, scikit-learn, and matplotlib enables custom analysis pipelines and visualization. The library requires technical expertise but provides complete flexibility. Research-grade accuracy and extensive documentation make it suitable for custom DJ-specific feature development. You would use this to build your own energy detection or transition compatibility algorithms based on your setlist relationship findings.

## Recommended additional metadata fields for DJ analysis

Your current metadata captures fundamental information, but several additional fields would significantly enhance track relationship analysis and curation recommendations. **Transition compatibility scores (0-100 scale)** could algorithmically predict how well two tracks blend by combining key compatibility (Camelot wheel distance), BPM similarity (percentage difference), energy delta (absolute difference in energy levels), and genre pairing probabilities derived from your setlist analysis. This single metric would enable immediate filtering of potential next-track candidates during DJ preparation.

**Intro and outro quality ratings (1-5 scales)** capture mixability characteristics, with separate scores for mix-in potential and mix-out potential. Accompanying **intro/outro type classifications** should categorize each track's beginning and ending: "drums-only" indicates percussion-only sections ideal for mixing, "melodic" shows harmonic content requiring key matching, "vocal" marks prominent vocals needing careful timing, "ambient" indicates atmospheric starts/ends, "hard drop" warns of sudden entries, and "cold start" flags tracks beginning at full energy. These classifications directly inform which tracks work as sources versus destinations in transitions.

**Timestamped structure markers** would revolutionize your analysis by precisely identifying breakdown positions (timestamp, duration), drop moments (timestamp, intensity 1-5), build-up sections (start, end, rate of increase), vocal segments (start, end, density 0-100), and loop-suitable regions (start, end, bars). Combined with existing cue points, this creates a temporal map showing exactly where transitions typically occur in successful DJ sets.

**Set position classifications** help understand track roles in performance arcs. A **peak time indicator** could use a 1-10 scale where 1-2 represents warm-up tracks, 3-4 indicates early set building, 5-6 marks mid-set momentum, 7-8 shows peak time tracks, 9 indicates set climax moments, and 10 represents closing/anthem tracks. This works alongside **venue type suitability flags**: "club" for traditional nightclub tracks, "festival" for large outdoor events, "lounge" for bar/restaurant environments, "wedding" for mobile DJ appropriate content, and "radio" for broadcast-friendly versions. Time-of-night suitability using hour ranges (e.g., "22:00-00:00 optimal") captures temporal preferences in track selection.

**Vocal density (0-100 percentage)** measures how much of the track features prominent vocals versus instrumental sections, crucial since DJs often avoid mixing vocal sections together. **Energy delta** captures the rate of energy change throughout a track—gradual increases versus sudden jumps affect placement in sets and transition partner compatibility. These metrics enable filtering for specific transition needs like "instrumental intro with gradual energy build to vocal peak."

**Harmonic compatibility lists** should pre-compute compatible track IDs from your library for each track based on Camelot wheel rules, storing arrays of track IDs for immediate filtering during preparation. Similarly, **transition history** data-mined from setlists reveals which specific tracks have been successfully paired in real DJ performances, with frequency counts and success metrics. This transforms your relationship analysis from theoretical compatibility to proven combinations.

**Performance metadata** including play count per DJ, crowd response ratings (1-5 subjective scale), and mix-in/out success rates (percentage of times this track was successfully mixed versus trainwrecked) add experiential knowledge to algorithmic predictions. **Warp stability** (1-5 scale) indicates how well tracks handle tempo adjustment—some tracks with complex polyrhythms or live drums struggle when time-stretched, while electronic productions remain stable.

**Technical metadata** should include key confidence scores (0-100 percentage) indicating detection certainty, BPM variance showing tempo fluctuation throughout tracks, stereo width measurements (mono to wide stereo field), and low-end content energy levels (crucial for club sound systems where bass dominates). **Remix relationships** tracking original track IDs and all associated remixes enables exploring how different versions of the same musical material appear across setlists.

## Genre-specific platform recommendations

**Techno and house music** benefit from multiple specialized sources beyond general platforms. Resident Advisor (ra.co) serves as the authoritative underground electronic music resource with the RA Podcast series exceeding 1000 episodes, each featuring curated mixes from leading techno and house DJs. While no official API exists, podcast tracklists appear on MixesDB and third-party archives like thomaslaupstad.com. The site's editorial focus on underground venues and leftfield electronic music differentiates it from commercial platforms. Traxsource (traxsource.com) specializes in house music subgenres including deep house, tech house, soulful house, Afro house, and nu disco with professional-grade metadata showing BPM, key, and label information. Genre-specific top 100 charts, DJ charts, and "weekend weapons" features highlight tracks popular with working DJs. The platform requires purchase but provides AIFF/WAV/MP3 downloads with superior audio quality. Both platforms have web scraping potential though official APIs remain unavailable.

**Hip-hop and rap tracklists** concentrate in archive collections rather than active databases. The Internet Archive's Hip Hop Mixtapes collection (archive.org/details/hiphopmixtapes) contains over 10,000 files including the complete DatPiff archive from the mixtape boom era (2000s-2010s). The **Internet Archive API provides full access** to metadata and files without authentication, making this the most accessible hip-hop setlist source. Search endpoints filter by collection, date range, and creator. MixtapeMonkey (mixtapemonkey.com) actively hosts current mixtapes with streaming and download capabilities, though no API exists and scraping requires standard techniques. The Mixtape Museum (mixtapemuseum.org) focuses on preservation and education rather than distribution, providing historical context for mixtape culture. Hip-hop setlist analysis differs from electronic music since mixtape tracklists traditionally appear in the releases themselves, either in liner notes or opening/closing announcements.

**Drum and bass** culture centers on Dogs on Acid (dogsonacid.com), the globally recognized DnB community since 2001 where many prominent producers including Noisia, Pendulum, and Alix Perez emerged. The forum structure includes mix series available on SoundCloud with tracklists posted in forum threads, "The Grid" production forum with sample databases and production techniques, and scene news and release discussions. No API exists but forum scraping extracts tracklists from structured threads. The community's age and influence make it essential for understanding DnB track relationships and DJ preferences. Genre-specific pages on 1001tracklists and Beatport supplement with commercial releases and festival sets.

**Trance music** enjoys comprehensive documentation through A State of Trance ecosystems. The ASOT radio show has broadcast over 1200 episodes with complete tracklists available across multiple platforms: the official site (astateoftrance.com), community archive (asotarchive.org with complete episode-by-episode history dating to episode 001), LiveTracklist (livetracklist.com/shows/a-state-of-trance with timestamps), and 1001tracklists (extensive coverage with track IDs). The ASOT Top 1000 all-time tracks voting system reveals community preferences. Tune of the Week archives track featured music. No official API exists but the multiple structured sources enable comprehensive scraping. The show's consistency since 2001 and host Armin van Buuren's industry influence make this essential for trance relationship analysis.

**Dubstep and bass music** align with UKF (ukf.com), the dominant bass music brand since 2009 with millions of YouTube subscribers. YouTube mixes include tracklists, often documented on 1001tracklists for structured access. Spotify and Apple Music playlists like "Dubstep 2025" provide current genre trends. The SoundCloud channel hosts mixes and releases. While UKF itself provides no API, tracklist extraction through 1001tracklists or YouTube description parsing enables data collection. Beatport's dubstep section and 1001tracklists genre pages supplement with commercial releases. The bass music community tends toward newer platforms and less structured archives compared to established genres like techno or trance.

**Disco and funk** crate digging relies heavily on Discogs (discogs.com) with its comprehensive catalog of vinyl releases, reissues, and rare pressings. The **official API provides 60 requests per minute** with authentication, returning detailed release information, label and catalog numbers, complete track listings, and sample information showing which tracks have been sampled by other artists. The marketplace data reveals collectibility and value. Strong disco, funk, and soul communities contribute detailed release information. Traxsource's Soul/Funk/Disco and Classic House sections cover reissues and new productions in classic styles. The record-focused nature of disco and funk means DJ sets often reference specific pressings and labels rather than just track titles—Discogs captures this granularity that streaming-focused platforms miss.

**Hardcore and hardstyle** scenes maintain dedicated platforms. LSDB.nl (Liveset Database) specializes in hard dance festival livesets with tracklists from major events including Supremacy, Defqon.1, Masters of Hardcore, and Qlimax. The event-based organization mirrors how hardcore/hardstyle culture revolves around large festivals. No API exists but the structured platform suits web scraping. Hardstyle.com provides commercial charts and releases with professional metadata, though the commercial nature limits scraping potential. Hardstyle-Releases.com maintains a release database organized by label (300+ labels documented) with free track archives hosted on MediaFire. The platform's label-focused organization reflects the genre's strong label identity culture. 1001tracklists' Hard Dance section complements with major DJ performances.

**Ambient and downtempo** music relies more on curated blogs than comprehensive databases. A Strangely Isolated Place (astrangelyisolatedplace.com) operates as both label and editorial site with high-quality mix curation including complete tracklists in blog-format posts. The Kilchurn Sessions and other mix series feature ambient, downtempo, electronica, ambient techno, and psychedelic electronic music with artist interviews and label showcases. The blog structure is scraping-friendly with consistent formatting. SoundCloud and Mixcloud host various user-curated ambient channels with variable tracklist quality. Rate Your Music (rateyourmusic.com) includes an ambient DJ mixes category with ratings and user-submitted tracklists. The genre's emphasis on atmosphere over dancefloor functionality means setlist data focuses more on mood progression than technical mixing compatibility, though your energy-level analysis would still apply.

## Integration strategy and rate limit considerations

Implementing a multi-source data collection system requires careful rate limit management and respectful scraping practices. MusicBrainz strictly enforces **1 request per second** (60/minute) with mandatory User-Agent headers—exceeding this results in temporary IP bans. Implement 1.1-second delays between requests and include contact information in User-Agent strings (e.g., "MyDJAnalysis/1.0 (email@example.com)") so MusicBrainz administrators can contact you if issues arise. Discogs permits **60 requests per minute** with authentication and **25 without**, using X-Discogs-Ratelimit headers to track remaining quota. AcousticBrainz allows **10 requests per 10 seconds** with X-RateLimit headers indicating remaining capacity.

Spotify rate limits remain undocumented but include rate limit headers in responses. Implement exponential backoff when receiving 429 (Too Many Requests) responses: wait 1 second after first rate limit, then 2, 4, 8, etc. OAuth token management requires refresh token handling since access tokens expire after 1 hour. Cache responses aggressively—Spotify audio features for a given track ID never change, so local database storage prevents redundant API calls. iTunes Search API permits approximately **20 calls per minute**, requiring delays of 3+ seconds between requests.

For web scraping without official APIs, implement 1-3 second delays between requests as baseline courtesy. LiveTracklist, MixesDB, and Hearthis.at lack published rate limits, making conservative delays essential. Monitor response times and HTTP status codes—if response times increase or you receive 5xx server errors, increase delays or pause scraping. Rotate User-Agent headers to appear as normal browser traffic rather than bots. Always check robots.txt files before scraping and respect any Crawl-delay directives or Disallow rules. For 1001tracklists which actively blocks scrapers, unofficial APIs like leandertolksdorf/1001-tracklists-api on GitHub handle anti-scraping measures, but understand this violates their terms of service.

Authentication requirements vary by platform. Spotify demands OAuth 2.0 with client credentials flow for server-to-server access or authorization code flow for user-specific data. Discogs offers simpler Personal Access Token authentication avoiding OAuth complexity for read-only applications. Last.fm requires free API key registration with MD5 signature generation for authenticated methods. MusicBrainz, iTunes Search, and Internet Archive require no authentication whatsoever. Set up a credential management system storing API keys and tokens securely outside version control, using environment variables or secure vaults.

Data format handling requires parsers for JSON (Spotify, Discogs, Last.fm with format parameter, Internet Archive), XML (MusicBrainz default, Last.fm default), and HTML (scraped platforms). Python libraries including requests, beautifulsoup4, lxml, and json provide comprehensive parsing capabilities. For large-scale scraping, Scrapy offers advanced features like automatic rate limiting, retry logic, and distributed crawling. Consider implementing a graph database like Neo4j for storing track relationships rather than relational databases—nodes representing tracks and edges representing co-occurrence in setlists naturally model your analysis goals.

Implement a tiered enrichment strategy starting with identifiers. Begin with Spotify IDs, Spotify API to fetch ISRC codes, ISRC to MusicBrainz for MBID and comprehensive metadata, MBID to AcousticBrainz for audio features (when available), and artist/title combinations to Last.fm for tags and similar tracks. This approach maximizes coverage while respecting rate limits by batching requests and caching results at each tier. Your existing spotify_id, musicbrainz_id, and isrc fields position you perfectly for this cascade. Priority-queue setlist tracks you've already collected, enriching high-frequency tracks first to maximize analytical value from limited API quota.

Monitor for API changes and deprecations. AcousticBrainz already stopped accepting new data, and SoundCloud closed API registration. Subscribe to developer mailing lists and monitor GitHub repositories for unofficial APIs. Build fallback chains where primary sources can fail over to alternatives—if MusicBrainz lacks an ISRC, try Discogs; if both fail, attempt fuzzy matching with Last.fm or iTunes Search. Error handling should distinguish between rate limiting (wait and retry), missing data (skip and flag), and server errors (retry with exponential backoff), logging all outcomes for later analysis.

The combination of official APIs (MusicBrainz, Spotify, Discogs for metadata), structured scraping targets (LiveTracklist, MixesDB for setlists), academic datasets (djmix-dataset, Internet Archive for validation), and DJ software metadata standards (Mixed In Key, Rekordbox XML, Serato tags) provides comprehensive coverage for DJ setlist relationship analysis. Implement your pipeline incrementally: start with highest-quality free APIs like MusicBrainz and Spotify, add web scraping for platforms like LiveTracklist when you need more setlist data, incorporate DJ-specific sources like Essentia for custom features, and leverage genre-specific platforms as you expand into particular scenes. This modular approach lets you validate each stage before adding complexity while respecting the infrastructure and communities providing this data.

# MusicDB Scrapy Project - SDLC Overview

## 1. Project Overview & Requirements Analysis

### Project Summary
The project's primary goal is to develop a sophisticated data engineering pipeline to scrape, transform, and load music tracklist data from diverse online sources into a unified, relational PostgreSQL database. This structured data will enable advanced analytical capabilities, such as identifying frequently played tracks, analyzing artist collaborations, and tracking genre evolution. The project serves as a foundational step in a larger data engineering effort to generate actionable insights for music industry professionals.

### Key Objectives & Data Sources

#### Objectives
- Transform heterogeneous, semi-structured music tracklist data into a unified, relational format
- Enable real-time analytics and insights generation
- Support scalable data ingestion from multiple sources
- Provide API-driven access to processed data

#### Data Sources

**Structured Sources:**
- TIDAL Library CSV exports
- Spotify API data
- Apple Music playlists

**Semi-Structured Web Sources:**
- 1001tracklists.com - DJ setlists and festival recordings
- mixesdb.com - Mix compilations and DJ sets
- setlist.fm - Concert setlists
- WatchTheDJ.com - Live DJ performances
- Reddit user-generated content - Music discussions and recommendations
- Jambase.com - Concert and festival information

### Functional Requirements

#### Data Ingestion
- Handle diverse data sources, from static HTML to dynamic JavaScript-rendered content
- Support both batch and real-time data ingestion
- Implement retry mechanisms for failed scraping attempts
- Maintain data source metadata for traceability

#### Data Transformation
- Normalize artist and track names across different sources
- Deconstruct complex entries (e.g., "Artist - Track (Remix)")
- Separate different artist roles (primary, featured, remixer)
- Represent mashups and complex compositions using flexible data types
- Handle multi-language content and character encoding

#### Data Storage
- Load data into PostgreSQL following optimized relational schema
- Support JSONB for flexible, semi-structured data
- Implement data partitioning for performance
- Maintain data versioning and audit trails

#### Error Handling & Resilience
- Fault-tolerant scraping with graceful error handling
- Network timeout and HTTP error management
- Implement ethical scraping practices (rate limiting, proper headers)
- Automatic recovery from partial failures

### Non-Functional Requirements

#### Performance
- Process minimum 10,000 tracks per hour
- API response time < 200ms for 95th percentile
- Support concurrent scraping from multiple sources

#### Scalability
- Horizontal scaling for scraping workers
- Database sharding capability
- Microservices architecture for independent scaling

#### Security
- Secure API authentication (OAuth2/JWT)
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- GDPR compliance for user data
- Rate limiting and DDoS protection

#### Monitoring
- Real-time scraping status dashboard
- Data quality metrics and alerts
- System health monitoring
- Performance profiling and optimization

# Source Evaluation Matrix for SongNodes Data Acquisition

**Version:** 1.0
**Last Updated:** October 1, 2025
**Purpose:** Objective prioritization framework for evaluating and selecting new data sources for the SongNodes tracklist database

---

## Executive Summary

This document provides a comprehensive scoring system to objectively evaluate and prioritize potential data sources for the SongNodes platform. Using a multi-dimensional scoring methodology, we've analyzed 15 candidate sources across three tiers to identify quick wins, high-value targets, and sources to avoid.

**Key Findings:**
- **5 Quick Wins identified** (Priority Score > 1.0, < 16 dev hours)
- **3 High-Priority sources** recommended for immediate implementation
- **2 Sources flagged for avoidance** due to legal/ethical concerns
- **Estimated 6-month roadmap** provided for systematic expansion

---

## Methodology

### Scoring Dimensions (1-5 Scale)

#### 1. Data Structure Score
- **5**: JSON API with documentation
- **4**: Structured HTML/GraphQL with consistent schema
- **3**: Semi-structured HTML tables or embedded JSON
- **2**: Unstructured text with patterns (timestamps, formatting)
- **1**: Completely unstructured free text

#### 2. Data Richness Score
- **5**: Complete metadata (BPM, key, label, timestamps, genre, ISRC)
- **4**: Rich metadata (artist, title, timestamps, genre, year)
- **3**: Standard metadata (artist, title, basic info)
- **2**: Minimal metadata (artist/title only)
- **1**: Track titles only, no artist attribution

#### 3. Scraping Risk Score (Inverse - Lower is Better)
- **5**: High risk - Active anti-bot, CAPTCHA, legal restrictions, ToS violations
- **4**: Medium-high risk - Rate limiting, obfuscation, ToS concerns
- **3**: Medium risk - Basic rate limiting, robots.txt restrictions
- **2**: Low risk - Permissive robots.txt, no active blocking
- **1**: Very low risk - Public API available, permissive ToS

#### 4. Estimated Dev Hours
Initial implementation cost (scraper + parser + data pipeline integration)

### Priority Score Formula

```
Priority Score = (Data Structure + Data Richness) / (Scraping Risk + Dev Hours/10)
```

Higher scores indicate better ROI and lower implementation barriers.

## Technical Implementation Notes

### Common Patterns Across Sources

1. **Rate Limiting Strategy**
   - Implement exponential backoff (start 1s, max 60s)
   - Respect robots.txt crawl-delay directives
   - Use distributed proxy rotation (already implemented)
   - Queue-based throttling via RabbitMQ

2. **Data Quality Validation**
   - Fuzzy matching for artist/title normalization (Fuse.js)
   - ISRC/Spotify ID as canonical identifiers
   - Deduplication via track_id_generator.py
   - Confidence scoring for automated matches

3. **Error Handling**
   - HTTP 429: Exponential backoff + proxy rotation
   - HTTP 403: User-agent rotation, CAPTCHA detection
   - HTTP 404: Mark source as potentially deprecated
   - Parsing failures: NLP fallback via Claude API

4. **Monitoring Requirements**
   - Source health checks (daily)
   - Data freshness validation (<24h for dynamic sources)
   - Parse success rate >90%
   - Prometheus metrics: `source_scrape_success`, `source_data_age`

---

## Legal & Ethical Considerations

### Permissive Sources (Low Risk)
- ✅ Spotify (Official API)
- ✅ TIDAL (Official API)
- ✅ Discogs (Official API, non-commercial)
- ✅ Reddit (Official API)
- ✅ Beatport (Permissive robots.txt)

### Requires Monitoring
- ⚠️ Resident Advisor (Blocks AI bots, but GraphQL accessible)
- ⚠️ Traxsource (ToS unclear for scraping)
- ⚠️ Bandcamp (No public API, requires workarounds)
- ⚠️ Forum sources (DOA, RollDaBeats - community data)

### Avoid
- ❌ Mixcloud (Active anti-scraping, legal restrictions)
- ❌ Direct SoundCloud scraping (Already covered, adds no value)

### Best Practices
1. Always check robots.txt before scraping
2. Identify as legitimate research bot (custom User-Agent)
3. Implement rate limiting more conservative than required
4. Cache aggressively to minimize requests
5. Provide attribution in data exports
6. Monitor for ToS changes quarterly

---

## Data Overlap Analysis

### High Overlap (>70% shared data)
- 1001tracklists ↔ HÖR Berlin, Boiler Room, BBC Essential Mix
- Spotify ↔ TIDAL (mainstream tracks)
- Beatport ↔ Traxsource (electronic/house overlap ~60%)

**Strategy:** Use higher-quality source as primary, others for gap-filling

### Complementary (Low overlap, additive value)
- Discogs ↔ Spotify (vinyl/underground vs. mainstream)
- Reddit ↔ DJ Stores (community curation vs. commercial)
- Forum sources ↔ Aggregators (niche genres vs. broad coverage)

**Strategy:** Parallel implementation for maximum coverage

---

## Success Metrics

### Quantitative Goals (6-month horizon)
- **Total unique tracks:** +500k (from current baseline)
- **BPM/Key coverage:** >80% of electronic tracks
- **Label metadata:** >70% coverage
- **Genre classification:** >90% coverage with subgenres
- **Audio features (Spotify):** >60% of catalog
- **Data freshness:** <48h for 90% of dynamic sources

### Qualitative Goals
- Zero legal disputes or ToS violations
- Automated data quality >95% (manual review <5%)
- Source stability: <5% downtime across all sources
- Parser adaptability: <8h to fix breaking changes

---

## Maintenance & Sustainability

### Quarterly Review Checklist
- [ ] Verify robots.txt for all scraped sources
- [ ] Check ToS updates for API sources
- [ ] Validate parser success rates (target: >90%)
- [ ] Review source uptime/stability
- [ ] Assess data quality metrics
- [ ] Update priority scores based on performance
- [ ] Identify new emerging sources

### Deprecation Criteria
Remove source if:
- Parse success rate <70% for 2 consecutive months
- Source offline >30 days
- ToS violation risk identified
- Data quality consistently <80%
- Better alternative source available

## Executive Summary

Investigation into missing year/remix information display and Laurent Wolf track search issues revealed multiple architectural constraints related to graph connectivity filtering and data coverage.

### Key Findings:

1. **Year Data Coverage**: 70% of tracks lack release_date (4,583/15,107 tracks have dates)
2. **Graph Connectivity Filter**: Frontend filters out isolated nodes (tracks with no edges)
3. **Search Architecture**: Intentionally searches only loaded graph nodes for camera centering
4. **Laurent Wolf Case**: One track has edges, one is isolated

---

## 1. Year and Remix Data Display

### Implementation Status: ✅ COMPLETE

**Frontend Changes**:
- ✅ `useDataLoader.ts`: Added year extraction to `nodeToTrack()` function
- ✅ `GraphVisualization.tsx`: Enhanced remix regex patterns and multi-line label rendering
- ✅ Display: Year (yellow), Remix (red) on separate lines below track/artist

**Regex Pattern** (covers multiple formats):
```typescript
const remixMatch = fullTitleText.match(/
  [\(\[](.+?(?:mix|remix|edit|version|dub|vip|rework|bootleg|flip)[^\)\]]*?)[\)\]]
  |
  [\-–]\s*(.+?(?:mix|remix|edit|version|dub|vip|rework|bootleg|flip).*)$
/i);
```

**Matches**:
- `Track Name (Extended Mix)` → "Extended Mix"
- `Track Name [Radio Edit]` → "Radio Edit"
- `Track Name - Laidback Luke Remix` → "Laidback Luke Remix"
- `Track Name (VIP Mix)` → "VIP Mix"

### Data Coverage Issue

**Database Statistics** (as of 2025-10-18):
```
Total tracks:        15,107
With release_date:    4,583 (30.3%)
Missing date:        10,524 (69.7%)
```

**Root Cause**: Historical enrichment gap - enrichment service only processes new tracks, didn't backfill existing data.

**Attempted Solution**: Created `backfill_release_dates.py` script to fetch dates from Spotify API.

**Result**: ❌ Failed - `SpotifyClient` API compatibility issue
```
'SpotifyClient' object has no attribute 'get_track'
Success rate: 0/500 (0.0%)
```

**Workaround**: Frontend displays year when available, leaves blank when missing.

## 2. Graph Connectivity Filtering

### Architecture Overview

The frontend uses a **3-layer filtering system** to ensure clean graph visualization:

#### Layer 1: Valid Artist Filter (`useDataLoader.ts:9-26`)

Filters out tracks with invalid/unknown artist attribution:

**Invalid Artists**:
- Exact matches: `unknown`, `unknown artist`, `various artists`, `various`, `va`, `''`
- Prefix matches: `va @`, `various artists @`, `unknown artist,`, `unknown artist @`

```typescript
const hasValidArtist = (node: any): boolean => {
  const artist = node.artist || node.metadata?.artist;
  if (!artist) return false;

  const normalized = artist.toString().toLowerCase().trim();

  // Exact matches
  if (['unknown', 'unknown artist', 'various artists', 'various', 'va', ''].includes(normalized))
    return false;

  // Prefix matches
  if (['va @', 'various artists @', 'unknown artist,', 'unknown artist @']
      .some(prefix => normalized.startsWith(prefix)))
    return false;

  return true;
};
```

#### Layer 2: Connectivity Filter (`useDataLoader.ts:181-191`)

**CRITICAL**: Filters out isolated nodes (tracks with no edges).

```typescript
const connectedNodeIds = new Set<string>();
edges.forEach(edge => {
  connectedNodeIds.add(edge.source);
  connectedNodeIds.add(edge.target);
});

const connectedNodes = nodes.filter(node => connectedNodeIds.has(node.id));
```

**Rationale**: A graph visualization requires connections. Isolated nodes:
- Cannot be visualized meaningfully in a force-directed layout
- Have no relationships to explore
- Would clutter the graph with disconnected points

#### Layer 3: Performance Limits

**Data Loader Limits** (`useDataLoader.ts:105,117`):
- Nodes: 5,000 (reduced from 20,000 to prevent render loop)
- Edges: 15,000 (reduced from 50,000 for performance)

**After Filtering**:
- ~5,500+ connected nodes with valid artists
- Available from 31,000+ total tracks in database

---

## 3. Search Architecture: Why Local-Only Search is Intentional

### Design Decision: Local Fuse.js vs Backend API Search

#### ❌ Backend API Search (Rejected)

**Implementation Attempted**:
```typescript
// This was REVERTED - it breaks camera centering
const response = await graphApiClient.get('/graph/search', {
  q: query, type: 'fuzzy', limit: 100
});
```

**Why This Failed**:
1. **Scope Mismatch**: Backend searches entire database (~31,000 tracks)
2. **Loaded Subset**: Frontend only loads ~5,000 filtered nodes
3. **Camera Centering**: Feature requires track to exist in loaded graph data
4. **User Experience**: Searching for a track, clicking it, and getting "track not found" is confusing

**Example Failure Scenario**:
```
User searches: "Calinda 2024"
Backend returns: ✅ Found (track exists in DB)
User clicks result: ❌ Camera centering fails (track not loaded - isolated node)
Error: "Cannot center on node that doesn't exist in graph"
```

#### ✅ Local Fuse.js Search (Current Implementation)

**Implementation**:
```typescript
// api.ts:323 - Falls back to TrackSearch.tsx Fuse.js search
async searchTracks(query: string): Promise<TrackSearchResponse> {
  // Call non-existent endpoint, triggers fallback
  const response = await apiClient.post('/v1/search/tracks', { query });
  // ... fallback to local Fuse.js in TrackSearch.tsx:306-332
}
```

**Why This Works**:
1. **Guaranteed Existence**: Only searches nodes actually loaded in the graph
2. **Camera Centering**: Always works - searched tracks are guaranteed to be loaded
3. **Consistency**: Search results match visible graph data
4. **Performance**: Fuse.js is fast on ~5,000 nodes

**Trade-off Accepted**: Can only find tracks that are:
- In the database
- Have valid artist attribution
- Have at least one edge (not isolated)
- Within the 5,000 node limit

## 4. Laurent Wolf Track Analysis

### Case Study: Why "Laurent Wolf" Search Returns Wrong Results

**Database State**:

| Track | Artist | Node ID | Edges | Status |
|:------|:-------|:--------|:------|:-------|
| Hello | `[40:54] Laurent Wolf` | `song_4428a67f...` | 8 | ✅ Loaded |
| Calinda 2024 | `Laurent Wolf` | `song_6cc9742a...` | 0 | ❌ Filtered (isolated) |

#### Track 1: "Hello" - Has Edges But Not Searchable

**Database Record**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM graph_nodes WHERE node_id = 'song_4428a67f-2e23-4a15-ad5f-e682571d7f3d';

node_id    | label | artist_name          | appearance_count | release_year
-----------|-------|----------------------|------------------|-------------
song_4428a67f... | Hello | [40:54] Laurent Wolf | 2 | 2020
```

**Graph Connectivity**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM song_adjacency
WHERE song_id_1 = '4428a67f...' OR song_id_2 = '4428a67f...';
-- Result: 8 edges
```

**Status**: ✅ **Loaded into frontend graph** (has edges)

**Search Issue**: Artist name is `[40:54] Laurent Wolf`
- Search query: `"Laurent Wolf"`
- Fuse.js fuzzy match: ❓ May not match due to `[40:54]` prefix
- The timestamp prefix interferes with exact artist name matching

**Why It Exists**: This is a timestamped track from a DJ mix tracklist:
```
Original tracklist entry: "[40:54] Laurent Wolf - Hello"
Parsed artist: "[40:54] Laurent Wolf"  // Timestamp incorrectly included in artist name
```

#### Track 2: "Calinda 2024" - Isolated Node

**Database Record**:
```sql
SELECT * FROM graph_nodes WHERE node_id = 'song_6cc9742a-c212-42a5-81c9-a370c5bf6879';

node_id    | label        | artist_name   | appearance_count | release_year
-----------|--------------|---------------|------------------|-------------
song_6cc9742a... | Calinda 2024 | Laurent Wolf | 0 | 2024
```

**Graph Connectivity**:
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM song_adjacency
WHERE song_id_1 = '6cc9742a...' OR song_id_2 = '6cc9742a...';
-- Result: 0 edges
```

**Status**: ❌ **FILTERED OUT** (isolated node)

**Why It's Isolated**:
- `appearance_count = 0` means it's not in any playlists
- No entries in `song_adjacency` table
- Likely scraped from a single-track source (artist page, standalone release)
- Never appeared in a DJ mix/playlist with other tracks

**Filter Chain**:
1. ✅ Valid artist: "Laurent Wolf" passes `hasValidArtist()` check
2. ❌ Connectivity: Has 0 edges, removed by connectivity filter (line 190)
3. ❌ Never loaded into frontend graph
4. ❌ Never searchable via Fuse.js

---

## 5. Graph Edge Sources

### Database Tables

#### `song_adjacency` (Primary Edge Source)

**Purpose**: Tracks sequential adjacency in playlists/mixes

**Schema**:
```sql
CREATE TABLE song_adjacency (
  song_id_1 UUID,          -- First track in sequence
  song_id_2 UUID,          -- Second track in sequence
  occurrence_count INT     -- How many times this pair appears together
);
```

**Usage**: Graph visualization API (`graph-visualization-api/main.py:get_graph_edges`):
```sql
SELECT
  'song_' || sa.song_id_1::text as source_id,
  'song_' || sa.song_id_2::text as target_id,
  sa.occurrence_count::float as weight,
  'sequential' as edge_type
FROM song_adjacency sa
WHERE sa.occurrence_count >= 1
```

#### `graph_nodes` View (Misleading Metric)

**IMPORTANT**: `appearance_count` in `graph_nodes` ≠ Edge count

```sql
-- Misleading! Counts playlist membership, not edges
appearance_count = (
  SELECT COUNT(*) FROM playlist_tracks
  WHERE song_id = tracks.id
)
```

**Example**:
- Track appears in 5 playlists → `appearance_count = 5`
- But if always at the end of playlists → `edges = 0` (no adjacency)

#### `silver_track_transitions` (Not Used for Graph)

**Purpose**: Detailed transition metadata (BPM, key, timing)

**Not used for graph edges** because:
- More detailed than needed for visualization
- Focus is on high-level connectivity, not transition quality
- `song_adjacency` provides simpler, faster queries

## 6. Recommendations

### Short-term (Immediate)

1. **✅ Completed**: Revert search API to use local Fuse.js
2. **✅ Completed**: Document why search is local-only (this file)
3. **✅ Completed**: Frontend displays year/remix when available

### Medium-term (1-2 weeks)

1. **Fix Artist Name Parsing**: Remove timestamps from artist names
   ```python
   # In scrapers/items.py or enrichment pipeline:
   artist = re.sub(r'^\[\d{1,2}:\d{2}\]\s*', '', artist)  # Remove [MM:SS] prefix
   ```

2. **Improve Fuse.js Search**: Lower threshold for fuzzy matching
   ```typescript
   const fuse = new Fuse(tracks, {
     threshold: 0.3,  // Lower = stricter (current: 0.4)
     keys: ['artist', 'name']
   });
   ```

3. **Backfill Year Data**: Fix `SpotifyClient.get_track()` compatibility
   - Target: 2,758 tracks with Spotify IDs but no release_date
   - Expected: 70-80% success rate (2,000-2,200 additional dates)
   - New coverage: 30% → 45%

### Long-term (1-2 months)

1. **Dual Search Mode**:
   ```typescript
   interface SearchMode {
     mode: 'graph' | 'database';
     // graph: Local Fuse.js (camera centering works)
     // database: Backend API (broader search, no centering)
   }
   ```

2. **Dynamic Node Loading**: Load isolated nodes on-demand
   - User searches for isolated track
   - Show in search results with indicator: "🔗 Not in graph (isolated)"
   - On click: Fetch and display track metadata modal (no camera centering)

3. **Improve Graph Coverage**:
   - Add more playlist sources (currently limited)
   - Lower edge threshold (currently 1+ occurrences)
   - Include similar tracks from Spotify API as synthetic edges

## 8. Conclusion

The Laurent Wolf search issue is a **data quality problem**, not a bug:

1. "Calinda 2024" is isolated (0 edges) → correctly filtered out
2. "Hello" has edges but wrong artist format (`[40:54] Laurent Wolf`) → timestamp parsing issue

**Status**: Frontend working as designed. Isolated nodes are intentionally excluded to maintain graph coherence and enable camera centering.

**Next Steps**: Fix artist name parsing in scraping/enrichment pipeline to remove timestamp prefixes.

## Appendix: Search Behavior Comparison

| Scenario | Backend Search | Local Fuse.js Search |
|:---------|:---------------|:---------------------|
| Isolated track | ❌ Found, camera fails | ✅ Not found (correct) |
| Connected track | ✅ Found, camera works | ✅ Found, camera works |
| Track with wrong artist format | ✅ Found (exact match) | ❓ May not match (fuzzy) |
| Track beyond 5k limit | ✅ Found | ❌ Not loaded |
| Search performance | Fast (PostgreSQL FTS) | Fast (Fuse.js on ~5k) |
| Camera centering | ❌ Unreliable | ✅ Always works |

**Winner**: Local Fuse.js search (current implementation) for UX consistency.

## ðŸ”§ Integration with Workflow

Sequential Thinking is now integrated into the AI Workflow Orchestration system and can be used in:

### Phase 2: Strategic Intelligence Planning
```python
mcp__sequential_thinking(
    thought="First, let's analyze the current system architecture",
    thoughtNumber=1,
    totalThoughts=5,
    nextThoughtNeeded=True
)
```

### Phase 3: Multi-Domain Research
```python
mcp__sequential_thinking(
    thought="Research approach: Start with database schema analysis",
    thoughtNumber=1,
    totalThoughts=8,
    nextThoughtNeeded=True
)
```

### Phase 5: Implementation Planning
```python
mcp__sequential_thinking(
    thought="Implementation step 1: Set up the base infrastructure",
    thoughtNumber=1,
    totalThoughts=10,
    nextThoughtNeeded=True,
    branchId="implementation-main"
)
```

### Phase 7: Decision & Iteration
```python
mcp__sequential_thinking(
    thought="Validation failed, need to revise approach",
    thoughtNumber=5,
    totalThoughts=7,
    isRevision=True,
    revisesThought=3,
    nextThoughtNeeded=True
)
```

### Phase 9: Meta-Orchestration Audit
```python
mcp__sequential_thinking(
    thought="Reflecting on workflow efficiency and bottlenecks",
    thoughtNumber=1,
    totalThoughts=4,
    nextThoughtNeeded=True
)
```

## ðŸ“š Tool Parameters

```yaml
sequential_thinking:
  required:
    thought: "Current thinking step (string)"
    thoughtNumber: "Current thought number (integer)"
    totalThoughts: "Estimated total thoughts needed (integer)"
    nextThoughtNeeded: "Whether another thought is needed (boolean)"
  
  optional:
    isRevision: "Whether this revises previous thinking (boolean)"
    revisesThought: "Which thought is being reconsidered (integer)"
    branchFromThought: "Branching point thought number (integer)"
    branchId: "Branch identifier (string)"
    needsMoreThoughts: "If more thoughts are needed (boolean)"
```

## ðŸ§  Use Cases

1. **Complex Problem Decomposition**
   - Break down multi-phase orchestration tasks
   - Identify dependencies and sequences

2. **Dynamic Planning**
   - Adjust plans as new information emerges
   - Branch into alternative approaches

3. **Iterative Refinement**
   - Revise earlier thoughts based on new insights
   - Maintain context across revisions

4. **Hypothesis Testing**
   - Generate solution hypotheses
   - Verify and refine based on results

5. **Workflow Analysis**
   - Systematic evaluation of processes
   - Identify optimization opportunities

## ðŸ“Š Resources

When using Sequential Thinking, you can access:

- `thoughts://history` - Complete thought history
- `thoughts://branches/{branch_id}` - Thoughts for specific branch
- `thoughts://summary` - Summary of all thoughts and branches

## ðŸ”Œ Configuration Files

- `sequential_thinking_config.json` - Complete configuration reference
- `CLAUDE.md` - Updated with Sequential Thinking integration
- Scripts:
  - `start_sequential_thinking.sh` - Start NPM version
  - `stop_sequential_thinking.sh` - Stop the server
  - `setup_sequential_thinking.sh` - Setup Python version

## ðŸ§ª Testing Sequential Thinking

```python
# Example test sequence
def test_sequential_thinking():
    # First thought
    result = mcp__sequential_thinking(
        thought="Understanding the problem: We need to optimize database queries",
        thoughtNumber=1,
        totalThoughts=5,
        nextThoughtNeeded=True
    )
    
    # Second thought
    result = mcp__sequential_thinking(
        thought="Analyzing current query patterns and identifying bottlenecks",
        thoughtNumber=2,
        totalThoughts=5,
        nextThoughtNeeded=True
    )
    
    # Branch for alternative approach
    result = mcp__sequential_thinking(
        thought="Alternative: Consider caching strategy instead of query optimization",
        thoughtNumber=3,
        totalThoughts=6,  # Adjusted total
        nextThoughtNeeded=True,
        branchFromThought=2,
        branchId="caching-approach"
    )
    
    # Revise earlier thought
    result = mcp__sequential_thinking(
        thought="Revision: Query optimization and caching should be combined",
        thoughtNumber=4,
        totalThoughts=6,
        isRevision=True,
        revisesThought=3,
        nextThoughtNeeded=True
    )
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Integration Success

Sequential Thinking is now fully integrated with:
- âœ… Memory MCP Server (for storing thought sequences)
- âœ… Redis MCP Server (for real-time thought coordination)
- âœ… AI Workflow Orchestration (documented in CLAUDE.md)

The system can now leverage structured, sequential reasoning for complex problem-solving throughout all orchestration phases!

   - WebGL2 context with high-performance power preference
   - Compute shader support with texture pooling
   - Real-time performance metrics collection
   - Graceful fallback to WebGL1

2. **Enhanced GraphCanvas** (`frontend/src/components/GraphCanvas/GraphCanvas.tsx`)
   - GPU optimizer integration with initialization handling
   - Performance monitoring overlay with GPU metrics
   - Fallback handling for WebGL failures

3. **WebGL Renderer** (`frontend/src/components/GraphCanvas/WebGLRenderer.tsx`)
   - GPU-optimized particle containers (up to 10,000 nodes)
   - Custom shader implementation with selection/highlight effects
   - Texture atlas optimization for memory efficiency

4. **Test Infrastructure**
   - Standalone GPU test page: http://localhost:3006/gpu-test.html
   - E2E validation suite for GPU performance testing
   - Performance analysis script with baseline measurements

#### ✅ Monitoring Integration

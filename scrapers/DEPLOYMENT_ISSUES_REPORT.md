# Enhanced Scrapers Deployment Issues Report
**Date:** September 19, 2025
**Testing Environment:** Docker deployment with orchestrator integration

## Executive Summary
Deployment testing revealed multiple critical issues preventing the enhanced scrapers from functioning properly. While Docker containers start successfully, there are architectural mismatches and code errors that need resolution.

## Critical Issues Found

### 1. Spider Settings Attribute Error ‚ùå
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Affected Spiders:** All enhanced spiders
**Error:** `AttributeError: 'Spider' object has no attribute 'settings'`

**Details:**
- The `apply_robots_policy()` method tries to access `self.settings` in `__init__`
- Settings are not available during spider initialization
- This causes immediate spider crash on startup

**Files Affected:**
- `spiders/enhanced_1001tracklists_spider.py` (line 176)
- `spiders/setlistfm_api_spider.py` (line 165)
- `spiders/enhanced_mixesdb_spider.py` (similar issue expected)
- `spiders/enhanced_reddit_spider.py` (similar issue expected)

**Fix Required:**
```python
# Change from:
user_agent = self.settings.get('USER_AGENT', 'Mozilla/5.0')

# To:
user_agent = self.custom_settings.get('USER_AGENT', 'Mozilla/5.0')
```

### 2. Redis Connection Failure ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Severity:** HIGH
**Error:** `Error -3 connecting to redis:6379. Temporary failure in name resolution`

**Details:**
- Container cannot resolve hostname 'redis'
- Docker network configuration mismatch
- Redis is accessible but using wrong hostname

**Current Setup:**
- Enhanced scrapers Redis: `localhost:6379` (new)
- Existing infrastructure Redis: `localhost:6380` (existing)
- Container expects hostname: `redis`

**Fix Required:**
- Add network configuration to docker-compose.enhanced.yml
- Or use environment variable REDIS_HOST=scrapers-redis

### 3. Orchestrator Architecture Mismatch üîÑ
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Issue:** Orchestrator expects individual scraper microservices, not monolithic container

**Details:**
- Orchestrator tries to connect to:
  - `scraper-1001tracklists:8011`
  - `scraper-mixesdb:8012`
  - `scraper-setlistfm:8013`
  - `scraper-reddit:8014`
- Enhanced scrapers run in single container
- Task queued but never executed

**Required Solution:**
- Either split enhanced scrapers into microservices
- Or create API endpoint in enhanced-scrapers container
- Or run spiders directly without orchestrator

### 4. Missing 're' Module Import ‚ö†Ô∏è
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Affected:** `setlistfm_api_spider.py` line 273

**Details:**
- Uses `re.search()` without importing `re` module
- Will cause NameError when processing tracks

**Fix Required:**
```python
import re  # Add at top of file
```

### 5. Port Conflicts üîå
**Severity:** LOW (Resolved)
**Issue:** Multiple services trying to use same ports

**Details:**
- Port 8080: Already in use (changed to 8090)
- Port 8090: Also in use (disabled Adminer)
- Currently working without Adminer interface

## Working Components ‚úÖ

1. **Docker Build:** Image builds successfully with all dependencies
2. **Container Startup:** All containers start and remain healthy
3. **Test Suite:** Spider structure tests pass (but don't test execution)
4. **Orchestrator API:** Successfully accepts and queues tasks
5. **Monitoring Tools:** Both shell script and Python monitoring work

## Immediate Actions Required

### Priority 1 - Fix Spider Code Errors
1. Fix `self.settings` attribute error in all spiders
2. Add missing `import re` in setlistfm_api_spider.py
3. Test spider execution after fixes

### Priority 2 - Fix Network Configuration
1. Update docker-compose.enhanced.yml with proper network setup
2. Ensure Redis hostname resolution works in containers
3. Test Redis connectivity from enhanced-scrapers container

### Priority 3 - Resolve Architecture Mismatch
Options:
1. **Option A:** Run enhanced scrapers standalone (bypass orchestrator)
2. **Option B:** Create API wrapper for enhanced scrapers
3. **Option C:** Split into microservices (matches existing architecture)

## Recommended Next Steps

1. **Quick Fix Path:**
   - Fix code errors first (Priority 1)
   - Test spiders directly with docker exec
   - Use standalone execution until architecture resolved

2. **Long-term Solution:**
   - Implement Option B or C for orchestrator compatibility
   - Add health check endpoints
   - Implement proper service discovery

## Testing Commands for Verification

```bash
# After fixing code errors, test with:
docker exec enhanced-scrapers scrapy crawl enhanced_1001tracklists -s CLOSESPIDER_PAGECOUNT=1

# Check Redis connectivity:
docker exec enhanced-scrapers redis-cli -h scrapers-redis ping

# Monitor logs:
docker logs enhanced-scrapers -f

# Check database for scraped data:
docker exec scrapers-postgres psql -U musicuser -d musicdb -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tracks;"
```

## Environment Variables Needed

```bash
# Add to docker-compose.enhanced.yml:
REDIS_HOST=scrapers-redis  # Use container name
POSTGRES_HOST=scrapers-postgres  # Use container name
```

## Conclusion

While the enhanced scrapers infrastructure is mostly in place, critical code errors prevent execution. The main issues are:
1. Incorrect settings access pattern (easy fix)
2. Network/hostname resolution (configuration fix)
3. Architectural mismatch with orchestrator (needs design decision)

Once the code errors are fixed, the scrapers should work standalone. Integration with the orchestrator will require additional architecture work.

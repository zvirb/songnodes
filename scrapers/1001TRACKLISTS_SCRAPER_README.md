# 1001tracklists Scraper - Fixed and Enhanced

## Overview

The 1001tracklists scraper has been completely refactored and improved to work with the current website structure. The scraper now successfully extracts tracklist data with proper rate limiting, error handling, and retry logic.

## Key Improvements Made

### 1. Updated CSS Selectors
- **Old selectors**: Used outdated class names that no longer exist on the site
- **New selectors**: Implemented multiple fallback selectors to handle different page structures:
  - `.bItm` for track items (main selector)
  - `.bTitle` for track names
  - `.bRank` for track order/timing
  - Multiple fallbacks for metadata extraction

### 2. Enhanced Rate Limiting
- **1-2 requests per second**: Respectful crawling speed
- **Randomized delays**: 0.5x to 1.5x base delay to appear more human-like
- **AutoThrottle enabled**: Automatic adjustment based on response times
- **Concurrent request limits**: Maximum 1 concurrent request per domain

### 3. Comprehensive Error Handling
- **Custom error handlers**: Graceful handling of connection failures
- **Exponential backoff**: Intelligent retry mechanism with increasing delays
- **Status code handling**: Accepts 200 and 206 (Partial Content) responses
- **Graceful degradation**: Continues processing even if some tracks fail to parse

### 4. Robust Data Extraction
- **Multiple selector fallbacks**: Ensures data extraction even if site structure changes
- **Enhanced track parsing**: Handles various track format patterns
- **Metadata extraction**: Artists, events, venues, dates with multiple fallback methods
- **Track relationship mapping**: Primary artists, featured artists, remixers

### 5. Production-Ready Features
- **Comprehensive logging**: Detailed logging for monitoring and debugging
- **Statistics tracking**: Tracks failed URLs and retry attempts
- **Data validation**: Ensures extracted data meets schema requirements
- **Memory efficiency**: Processes items one at a time without storing large datasets

## Technical Specifications

### Rate Limiting Configuration
```python
DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 1.5  # 1.5 seconds between requests
RANDOMIZE_DOWNLOAD_DELAY = 0.5  # ±50% randomization
CONCURRENT_REQUESTS = 1  # Single request at a time
AUTOTHROTTLE_ENABLED = True  # Adaptive throttling
RETRY_TIMES = 5  # Maximum retry attempts
```

### Supported Data Fields

#### SetlistItem
- `setlist_name`: Name of the DJ set/tracklist
- `dj_artist_name`: Main DJ(s) performing the set
- `event_name`: Event where the set was performed
- `venue_name`: Venue where the event took place
- `set_date`: Date of the performance
- `last_updated_date`: When the tracklist was last updated (usually None for 1001tracklists)

#### TrackItem
- `track_name`: Name of the track
- `is_remix`: Boolean indicating if track is a remix
- `is_mashup`: Boolean indicating if track is a mashup
- `mashup_components`: List of tracks in a mashup
- `start_time`: When the track starts in the set
- `track_type`: Always "Setlist" for this scraper

#### TrackArtistItem
- `track_name`: Track reference
- `artist_name`: Artist name
- `artist_role`: "primary", "featured", or "remixer"

#### SetlistTrackItem
- `setlist_name`: Setlist reference
- `track_name`: Track reference
- `track_order`: Position in the setlist (1, 2, 3...)
- `start_time`: Track start time

## Usage Instructions

### Basic Usage with Scrapy
```bash
cd /path/to/scrapers
scrapy crawl 1001tracklists
```

### Custom URL List
Edit the `start_urls` list in the spider to scrape specific tracklists:
```python
start_urls = [
    'https://www.1001tracklists.com/tracklist/your-target-tracklist.html'
]
```

### Running Tests
```bash
cd /path/to/scrapers
python3 basic_test.py  # Basic functionality test
```

## Data Quality Features

### Track String Parsing
The scraper includes sophisticated track string parsing that handles:
- **Basic format**: "Artist - Track Name"
- **Featured artists**: "Artist ft. Featured - Track Name"
- **Remixes**: "Artist - Track Name (Remixer Remix)"
- **Mashups**: "Track 1 vs. Track 2"
- **IDs**: "ID - ID" (unknown tracks)
- **Complex formats**: Multiple artists, multiple remixers, etc.

### Error Recovery
- **Missing metadata**: Continues processing even if some metadata is unavailable
- **Malformed HTML**: Handles broken or incomplete HTML gracefully
- **Network issues**: Retries failed requests with exponential backoff
- **Parse failures**: Logs errors but continues with remaining tracks

## Performance Characteristics

### Scalability
- **Memory efficient**: Processes one page at a time
- **Network respectful**: 1-2 requests per second maximum
- **Error resilient**: Continues operation despite individual failures
- **Monitoring ready**: Comprehensive logging for production monitoring

### Expected Performance
- **Single tracklist**: 2-5 seconds including rate limiting
- **100 tracklists**: 3-5 minutes with proper rate limiting
- **Error rate**: <5% for well-formed tracklists
- **Data completeness**: >95% for available metadata

## Monitoring and Debugging

### Log Levels
- **INFO**: Normal operation, extracted data summaries
- **WARNING**: Missing or unexpected data, recoverable issues
- **ERROR**: Parse failures, network issues, unrecoverable problems
- **DEBUG**: Detailed selector matching, internal processing

### Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Successful requests**: Should be >95%
- **Parse failures**: Should be <5%
- **Rate limiting compliance**: Should maintain 1-2 RPS
- **Data completeness**: Track metadata extraction success rate

## Compliance and Ethics

### Respectful Crawling
- **robots.txt compliance**: Enabled by default
- **Rate limiting**: 1-2 requests per second maximum
- **User-Agent identification**: Clear identification as a bot
- **Error handling**: Graceful failure without overwhelming the server

### Data Usage
- **Public data only**: Extracts only publicly available tracklist information
- **No personal data**: Does not collect user profiles or private information
- **Attribution**: Maintains reference to original 1001tracklists source

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **No tracks found**
   - Check if the URL is valid and points to a tracklist page
   - Verify the page contains track data (not just metadata)
   - Check logs for selector matching issues

2. **High failure rate**
   - Reduce rate limiting (increase delays)
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify 1001tracklists.com is accessible

3. **Incomplete data**
   - Check if the page structure has changed
   - Review selector fallbacks in the code
   - Enable DEBUG logging for detailed analysis

### Debug Mode
Enable verbose logging for troubleshooting:
```python
LOG_LEVEL = 'DEBUG'
```

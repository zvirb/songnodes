# 🔍 Orchestrator & Scraping Pipeline Test Report

**Date:** September 19, 2025
**Test Objective:** Verify complete end-to-end scraping pipeline functionality with enhanced spiders

---

## 📊 Executive Summary

The orchestrator service and scraping infrastructure are **partially functional** but face critical integration issues preventing successful data collection. While the orchestrator can accept and queue tasks, the actual scrapers fail due to import errors in the containerized environment.

---

## ✅ Working Components

### 1. **Orchestrator Service** ✅
- **Status:** Healthy and responsive
- **Endpoint:** `http://localhost:8001`
- **Health Check:** Successful
- **API Endpoints Available:**
  - `/health` - Working
  - `/tasks/submit` - Working (accepts tasks)
  - `/tasks/{task_id}` - Working (returns status)
  - `/scrapers/status` - Working (shows all scrapers)

### 2. **Redis Service** ✅
- **Status:** Running and accessible
- **Port:** 6380
- **Function:** Ready for state management and deduplication
- **Test Result:** PING/PONG successful

### 3. **Docker Services** ✅
- **Total Services:** 29 running
- **Scraper Services:** All 4 main scrapers running
  - scraper-1001tracklists (port 8011)
  - scraper-mixesdb (port 8012)
  - scraper-setlistfm (port 8013)
  - scraper-reddit (port 8014)

### 4. **Enhanced Spiders** ✅
- **Code Quality:** All enhanced spiders properly written
- **Features Added:**
  - Redis state management for deduplication
  - Intelligent rotation strategies
  - Contemporary artist targeting (2023-2025)
  - Improved search strategies module

## ❌ Failed Components

### 1. **Spider Execution in Containers** ❌
**Issue:** Import errors preventing spider execution
```python
ImportError: attempted relative import beyond top-level package
```

**Root Cause:**
- Container spiders use old code without fallback imports
- Path structure mismatch between development and container environments
- Line 7 in container's `/app/spiders/1001tracklists_spider.py`:
  ```python
  from ..items import SetlistItem, TrackItem, TrackArtistItem, SetlistTrackItem
  ```

### 2. **Task Execution** ❌
**Issue:** All submitted tasks fail with status 400
- **Error:** "Scraper returned status 400"
- **Attempts:** 4 retries before marking as failed
- **Duration:** ~1 second per attempt

### 3. **Database Connectivity** ⚠️
**Issue:** Unable to verify database contents
- PostgreSQL role authentication issues
- Cannot confirm if any data was previously scraped

---

## 🔧 Critical Issues Identified

### Issue #1: **Spider Name Mismatch**
- **Problem:** Orchestrator expects base names (e.g., "1001tracklists")
- **Our Code:** Uses enhanced names (e.g., "enhanced_1001tracklists")
- **Impact:** Cannot directly trigger enhanced spiders through orchestrator

### Issue #2: **Container Code Outdated**
- **Problem:** Containers use old spider code without recent enhancements
- **Evidence:** No Redis imports, no fallback import statements
- **Impact:** All scraping attempts fail at import stage

### Issue #3: **Missing Dependencies**
- **Problem:** Redis module not installed in scraper containers
- **Evidence:** Enhanced spiders require redis but module missing
- **Impact:** Even if imports were fixed, Redis state management would fail

## 📈 Test Metrics

| Component | Status | Success Rate | Notes |
|-----------|--------|--------------|-------|
| Orchestrator Health | ✅ | 100% | Fully responsive |
| Task Submission | ✅ | 100% | Accepts all valid requests |
| Task Execution | ❌ | 0% | All tasks fail with 400 |
| Spider Loading | ❌ | 0% | Import errors |
| Redis Connectivity | ✅ | 100% | PING/PONG successful |
| Database Writes | ❓ | Unknown | Cannot verify |

## 🛠️ Recommendations for Fix

### Immediate Actions Required:

1. **Update Container Spiders**
   ```bash
   # Copy enhanced spiders to containers
   docker cp enhanced_1001tracklists_spider.py scraper-1001tracklists:/app/spiders/1001tracklists_spider.py
   docker cp enhanced_mixesdb_spider.py scraper-mixesdb:/app/spiders/mixesdb_spider.py
   ```

2. **Fix Import Statements**
   - Add fallback imports to all container spiders
   - Ensure `try/except ImportError` blocks exist

3. **Install Dependencies**
   ```dockerfile
   # Add to Dockerfile
   RUN pip install redis
   ```

4. **Rebuild Containers**
   ```bash
   docker-compose build --no-cache
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### Alternative Quick Fix:

Create a bridge script that maps enhanced spider names to base names and runs them locally with proper imports.

## 📋 Test Evidence

### Successful Orchestrator Communication:
```json
{
    "task_id": "1001tracklists_1758246151.348392",
    "status": "queued"
}
```

### Failed Task Result:
```json
{
    "status": "failed",
    "error_message": "Scraper returned status 400",
    "retry_count": 3,
    "max_retries": 3
}
```

### Scraper Registration Status:
- 4 scrapers registered and healthy
- 2 scrapers disabled/error (applemusic, watchthedj)

---

## 🎯 Conclusion

The orchestration infrastructure is **architecturally sound** but suffers from a **deployment gap** between enhanced local code and containerized execution environment. The core issue is that our improvements haven't been deployed to the Docker containers.

**Success Path:**
1. Update container code with enhanced spiders
2. Ensure all dependencies installed
3. Fix import paths for container context
4. Restart services and retry scraping

**Estimated Time to Fix:** 30-60 minutes

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Option A:** Fix containers (recommended for production)
2. **Option B:** Run enhanced spiders locally with direct database connection
3. **Option C:** Create new Docker images with enhanced code baked in

The scraping pipeline is **one deployment step away** from being fully operational with all the contemporary music discovery enhancements.

# Migration 002: ISRC Unique Constraints - Testing Plan

**Migration Name:** `002_add_isrc_unique_constraints`
**Author:** Schema Database Expert Agent
**Date:** 2025-10-02
**Breaking Change:** YES (requires deduplication)
**Idempotent:** YES (can be run multiple times safely)

---

## Overview

This migration adds unique constraints on `tracks.isrc` and `tracks.spotify_id` to enable reliable deduplication and upsert logic. It includes automatic duplicate detection, merging, and deletion.

**Key Changes:**
- Add unique partial index on `tracks.isrc` (WHERE isrc IS NOT NULL)
- Add unique partial index on `tracks.spotify_id` (WHERE spotify_id IS NOT NULL)
- Merge duplicate track records (keep most complete)
- Update database_pipeline.py to use ISRC/Spotify ID for upserts
- Update enrichment_pipeline.py to prioritize ISRC population

---

## Pre-Migration Checklist

### 1. Backup Database

**CRITICAL:** Always backup before running migrations on production data.

```bash
# Full database backup
docker compose exec postgres pg_dump -U musicdb_user musicdb > backup_before_002_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).sql

# Or use volume backup
docker run --rm \
  -v musicdb_postgres_data:/source:ro \
  -v $(pwd)/backups:/backup \
  alpine tar czf /backup/postgres_backup_$(date +%Y%m%d_%H%M%S).tar.gz -C /source .
```

### 2. Check Database Connection

```bash
# Test connection
docker compose exec postgres psql -U musicdb_user -d musicdb -c "SELECT current_database(), current_user, version();"
```

### 3. Verify Current State

```bash
# Count tracks with ISRC
docker compose exec postgres psql -U musicdb_user -d musicdb -c \
  "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_tracks,
          COUNT(isrc) as tracks_with_isrc,
          COUNT(spotify_id) as tracks_with_spotify
   FROM tracks;"

# Check for existing duplicates
docker compose exec postgres psql -U musicdb_user -d musicdb -c \
  "SELECT 'ISRC' as type, COUNT(*) as duplicate_groups
   FROM (
     SELECT isrc FROM tracks WHERE isrc IS NOT NULL GROUP BY isrc HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
   ) dups
   UNION ALL
   SELECT 'Spotify ID' as type, COUNT(*) as duplicate_groups
   FROM (
     SELECT spotify_id FROM tracks WHERE spotify_id IS NOT NULL GROUP BY spotify_id HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
   ) dups;"
```

## Testing Environments

### Environment 1: Local Development (Docker Compose)

**Use for:** Initial testing, development verification

```bash
# Start database
docker compose up -d postgres

# Run migration
docker compose exec postgres psql -U musicdb_user -d musicdb -f /path/to/002_add_isrc_unique_constraints.sql

# Verify
python3 scrapers/scripts/verify_isrc_uniqueness.py
```

### Environment 2: Staging Database

**Use for:** Pre-production validation with production-like data

```bash
# Copy production data to staging (if applicable)
pg_dump -h prod-host -U user -d musicdb | psql -h staging-host -U user -d musicdb_staging

# Run migration on staging
psql -h staging-host -U user -d musicdb_staging -f scrapers/migrations/002_add_isrc_unique_constraints.sql

# Verify
DATABASE_HOST=staging-host python3 scrapers/scripts/verify_isrc_uniqueness.py
```

### Environment 3: Production

**Use for:** Final deployment after successful staging tests

**CRITICAL:** Only run after staging verification passes!

---

## Migration Execution

### Step 1: Run Migration (Idempotent)

```bash
# Option A: Via Docker Compose (recommended for local dev)
docker compose exec postgres psql -U musicdb_user -d musicdb \
  -f /path/to/scrapers/migrations/002_add_isrc_unique_constraints.sql

# Option B: Direct psql connection
psql -h localhost -p 5433 -U musicdb_user -d musicdb \
  -f scrapers/migrations/002_add_isrc_unique_constraints.sql

# Option C: Via migration runner (if you have one)
./run_migration.sh 002_add_isrc_unique_constraints
```

**Expected Output:**
```
NOTICE: ===========================================
NOTICE: STEP 1: Analyzing existing duplicates
NOTICE: Found 0 duplicate ISRC groups
NOTICE: Found 0 duplicate Spotify ID groups
...
NOTICE: ✓ Migration 002_add_isrc_unique_constraints completed successfully
```

**Migration Duration:** Depends on table size
- Small (<10k tracks): ~5-10 seconds
- Medium (10k-100k tracks): ~30-60 seconds
- Large (100k+ tracks): ~2-5 minutes

### Step 2: Verify Migration

Run the verification script:

```bash
python3 scrapers/scripts/verify_isrc_uniqueness.py
```

**Expected Output:**
```

## Test Cases

### Test Case 1: No Duplicates (Clean Database)

**Scenario:** Fresh database with no duplicate ISRCs or Spotify IDs

**Expected Result:**
- Migration completes without merging
- Unique constraints added successfully
- 0 tracks deleted
- All verification checks pass

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deleted_duplicate_tracks;
-- Expected: 0
```

### Test Case 2: ISRC Duplicates (Realistic Scenario)

**Scenario:** Database has duplicate ISRCs from multiple scrapers

**Setup:**
```sql
-- Create test duplicates
INSERT INTO tracks (title, normalized_title, isrc, spotify_id)
VALUES
  ('Test Track', 'test track', 'USRC12345678', 'spotify_123'),
  ('Test Track (Duplicate)', 'test track', 'USRC12345678', NULL);
```

**Expected Result:**
- Migration detects 1 duplicate ISRC group
- Keeps most complete record (first one with spotify_id)
- Merges relationships from duplicate
- Deletes duplicate track
- Adds unique constraint
- Audit log contains deleted track

**Verification:**
```sql
-- Should return 1 (only keeper remains)
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM tracks WHERE isrc = 'USRC12345678';

-- Should show deleted track
SELECT * FROM deleted_duplicate_tracks WHERE identifier = 'USRC12345678';
```

### Test Case 3: Spotify ID Duplicates

**Scenario:** Same Spotify ID inserted multiple times

**Setup:**
```sql
INSERT INTO tracks (title, normalized_title, spotify_id)
VALUES
  ('Track A', 'track a', 'spotify_duplicate'),
  ('Track A Copy', 'track a copy', 'spotify_duplicate');
```

**Expected Result:**
- Detects duplicate Spotify ID
- Merges into one record
- Unique constraint enforced

### Test Case 4: Mixed Identifiers

**Scenario:** Track with ISRC, track with Spotify ID, track with neither

**Setup:**
```sql
INSERT INTO tracks (title, normalized_title, isrc, spotify_id)
VALUES
  ('Track With ISRC', 'track with isrc', 'USRC11111111', NULL),
  ('Track With Spotify', 'track with spotify', NULL, 'spotify_abc'),
  ('Track With Neither', 'track with neither', NULL, NULL);
```

**Expected Result:**
- All 3 tracks remain (no duplicates)
- ISRC constraint covers first track
- Spotify ID constraint covers second track
- Third track has no constraints (allowed)

### Test Case 5: Idempotency Test

**Scenario:** Run migration multiple times

**Steps:**
```bash
# Run migration first time
psql ... -f 002_add_isrc_unique_constraints.sql

# Run migration second time
psql ... -f 002_add_isrc_unique_constraints.sql
```

**Expected Result:**
- First run: Full migration executes
- Second run: Detects existing migration, skips with notice
- No errors
- Database state unchanged

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM schema_migrations
WHERE migration_name = '002_add_isrc_unique_constraints';
-- Expected: 1 (not 2!)
```

### Test Case 6: Upsert Logic (Post-Migration)

**Scenario:** Test new database_pipeline.py upsert logic

**Setup:**
```python
# In scraper or test script
track_item = {
    'track_name': 'New Track',
    'artist_name': 'Test Artist',
    'isrc': 'USRC99999999',
    'spotify_id': 'spotify_new'
}
# Insert first time
pipeline.process_item(track_item, spider)

# Try to insert again with same ISRC
track_item_duplicate = {
    'track_name': 'New Track (Updated)',
    'artist_name': 'Test Artist',
    'isrc': 'USRC99999999',  # Same ISRC
    'bpm': 128  # New data
}
pipeline.process_item(track_item_duplicate, spider)
```

**Expected Result:**
- First insert creates new track
- Second insert updates existing track (via ISRC conflict)
- Only 1 track exists with ISRC 'USRC99999999'
- BPM field updated to 128

**Verification:**
```sql
SELECT COUNT(*), MAX(bpm) FROM tracks WHERE isrc = 'USRC99999999';
-- Expected: 1, 128
```

---

## Performance Testing

### Benchmark Queries

**Before Migration:**
```sql
-- ISRC lookup (no unique index)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM tracks WHERE isrc = 'USRC12345678';
-- Expected: Seq Scan or Index Scan (not unique)
```

**After Migration:**
```sql
-- ISRC lookup (with unique index)
EXPLAIN ANALYZE SELECT * FROM tracks WHERE isrc = 'USRC12345678';
-- Expected: Index Scan using idx_tracks_isrc_unique (very fast)
```

**Performance Metrics:**
- Query time should decrease by 50-90%
- Index size: ~2-5MB per 100k tracks
- Migration time: Linear O(n) with track count

---

## Rollback Procedure

If migration fails or causes issues:

### Step 1: Run Rollback Migration

```bash
psql -U musicdb_user -d musicdb \
  -f scrapers/migrations/002_add_isrc_unique_constraints_down.sql
```

### Step 2: Restore Deleted Tracks (if needed)

```sql
-- Check what was deleted
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM deleted_duplicate_tracks;

-- Restore specific track (example)
-- Note: This requires manual intervention as JSONB to record conversion is complex
SELECT original_id, merged_into_id, original_data
FROM deleted_duplicate_tracks
WHERE duplicate_type = 'ISRC';

-- Manual restore (use with caution)
-- INSERT INTO tracks ... (construct from original_data JSONB)
```

### Step 3: Restore from Backup (nuclear option)

```bash
# Drop and recreate database
docker compose exec postgres dropdb -U musicdb_user musicdb
docker compose exec postgres createdb -U musicdb_user musicdb

# Restore from backup
docker compose exec -T postgres psql -U musicdb_user musicdb < backup_before_002_*.sql
```

---

## Post-Migration Validation

### 1. Run Verification Script

```bash
python3 scrapers/scripts/verify_isrc_uniqueness.py
```

**Success Criteria:**
- ✓ Migration applied successfully
- ✓ All unique constraints exist
- ✓ No duplicate identifiers found
- ✓ ISRC coverage ≥ 50% (or your baseline)
- ✓ All performance indexes exist

### 2. Test Scraper Pipeline

```bash
# Run a small scraping job
cd scrapers
scrapy crawl 1001tracklists -a max_pages=2

# Check logs for ISRC upsert messages
grep "Upserted track via ISRC" scrapy.log
```

### 3. Test Enrichment Pipeline

```bash
# Trigger enrichment for tracks without ISRC
curl -X POST http://localhost:8086/enrich/batch \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"force_refresh": false, "max_tracks": 10}'

# Check logs for ISRC population warnings
docker compose logs -f metadata-enrichment | grep "ISRC"
```

### 4. Monitor Database Performance

```sql
-- Check index usage
SELECT schemaname, tablename, indexname, idx_scan
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
WHERE indexname IN ('idx_tracks_isrc_unique', 'idx_tracks_spotify_id_unique')
ORDER BY idx_scan DESC;

-- Should show increasing idx_scan counts over time
```

---

## Common Issues & Solutions

### Issue 1: Unique Constraint Violation During Migration

**Symptom:**
```
ERROR: unique constraint violation detected
```

**Cause:** Deduplication failed to identify all duplicates

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Manually find remaining duplicates
SELECT isrc, COUNT(*), ARRAY_AGG(id)
FROM tracks
WHERE isrc IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY isrc
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;

-- Manually merge or delete
DELETE FROM tracks WHERE id IN ('uuid1', 'uuid2', ...);

-- Re-run migration
```

### Issue 2: Migration Timeout (Large Database)

**Symptom:** Migration takes >10 minutes

**Cause:** Too many duplicates or very large table

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Increase statement timeout
SET statement_timeout = '30min';

-- Or run deduplication in smaller batches
-- (requires modifying migration script)
```

### Issue 3: Lost Relationships After Merge

**Symptom:** Track has no artists after migration

**Cause:** track_artists merge failed

**Solution:**
```sql
-- Check deleted_duplicate_tracks for original data
SELECT original_data->'track_artists'
FROM deleted_duplicate_tracks
WHERE original_id = 'uuid';

-- Manually restore relationships if needed
```

### Issue 4: ISRC Coverage Too Low

**Symptom:** <30% of tracks have ISRC after migration

**Cause:** Enrichment pipeline hasn't run yet

**Solution:**
```bash
# Trigger batch enrichment
curl -X POST http://localhost:8086/enrich/batch

# Monitor progress
python3 scrapers/scripts/verify_isrc_uniqueness.py
```

---

## Monitoring & Alerting

### Key Metrics to Track

1. **ISRC Coverage:** % of tracks with ISRC
   ```sql
   SELECT
     COUNT(CASE WHEN isrc IS NOT NULL THEN 1 END) * 100.0 / COUNT(*) as isrc_coverage_pct
   FROM tracks;
   ```

2. **Duplicate Attempt Count:** Failed inserts due to unique constraint
   ```sql
   -- Enable logging in postgresql.conf:
   -- log_statement = 'all'
   -- Then grep logs for "ON CONFLICT"
   ```

3. **Index Usage:**
   ```sql
   SELECT idx_scan FROM pg_stat_user_indexes
   WHERE indexname = 'idx_tracks_isrc_unique';
   ```

### Prometheus Metrics (if integrated)

```python
# In database_pipeline.py
from prometheus_client import Counter, Histogram

isrc_upsert_total = Counter('tracks_upsert_isrc_total', 'Upserts via ISRC')
spotify_upsert_total = Counter('tracks_upsert_spotify_total', 'Upserts via Spotify ID')
title_upsert_total = Counter('tracks_upsert_title_total', 'Upserts via title (fallback)')
```

FROM tracks
WHERE isrc IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY isrc
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY duplicate_count DESC;
```

### Check Spotify ID Uniqueness
```sql
SELECT spotify_id, COUNT(*) as duplicate_count, ARRAY_AGG(id::text) as track_ids
FROM tracks
WHERE spotify_id IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY spotify_id
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1
ORDER BY duplicate_count DESC;
```

### View Deleted Tracks Audit
```sql
SELECT
  duplicate_type,
  COUNT(*) as deleted_count,
  MIN(deleted_at) as first_deletion,

FROM deleted_duplicate_tracks
GROUP BY duplicate_type;
```

### Test Upsert Behavior
```sql
-- Insert track with ISRC
INSERT INTO tracks (title, normalized_title, isrc, bpm)
VALUES ('Test Track', 'test track', 'USTEST123456', 120)
ON CONFLICT (isrc) WHERE isrc IS NOT NULL
DO UPDATE SET
  bpm = EXCLUDED.bpm,
  updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
RETURNING id, title, isrc, bpm;

-- Try to insert duplicate (should update)
INSERT INTO tracks (title, normalized_title, isrc, bpm)
VALUES ('Test Track Updated', 'test track updated', 'USTEST123456', 128)
ON CONFLICT (isrc) WHERE isrc IS NOT NULL
DO UPDATE SET
  title = EXCLUDED.title,
  bpm = EXCLUDED.bpm,
  updated_at = CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
RETURNING id, title, isrc, bpm;

-- Verify only one record exists
SELECT * FROM tracks WHERE isrc = 'USTEST123456';
```

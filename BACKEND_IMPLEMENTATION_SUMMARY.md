- **Processing Capacity**: Designed for 20,000+ tracks/hour processing
- **WebSocket Connections**: Supports 1000+ concurrent collaborative sessions
- **Database Queries**: Optimized for <50ms average query time

## üèóÔ∏è Implemented Components

### 1. Graph Visualization API Service
**Location**: `/home/marku/Documents/programming/songnodes/services/graph-visualization-api/`

**Features**:
- FastAPI-based high-performance API
- Async/await architecture with uvloop optimization
- Redis-based caching with configurable TTL
- Circuit breaker pattern for resilience
- Compression for large message payloads
- Prometheus metrics integration

**Key Endpoints**:
- `POST /api/v1/visualization/graph` - Graph data retrieval with filtering
- `POST /api/v1/visualization/nodes/batch` - Bulk node processing
- `GET /api/v1/visualization/batch/{id}/status` - Batch status tracking
- `WS /api/v1/visualization/ws/{room_id}` - Real-time collaboration
- `GET /health` - Health check endpoint
- `GET /metrics` - Prometheus metrics

### 2. Database Schema Extensions
**Location**: `/home/marku/Documents/programming/songnodes/sql/init/04-graph-schema.sql`

**Enhanced Schema**:
- `nodes` table with spatial POINT indexing for graph positioning
- `edges` table with optimized relationship storage
- `audio_analysis` table with monthly partitioning for time-series data
- `graph_clusters` table for community detection algorithms

**Performance Optimizations**:
- GIST spatial indexes for position-based queries
- Composite indexes for graph traversal operations
- Materialized views for popular tracks and centrality metrics
- Bulk processing functions with conflict resolution

### 3. WebSocket Optimization
**Real-time Collaboration Features**:
- Connection pooling with automatic cleanup
- Message compression for payloads >1KB
- Room-based broadcasting for collaborative sessions
- Graceful error handling and reconnection support

### 4. Connection Pooling Optimization
**Location**: `/home/marku/Documents/programming/songnodes/services/db-connection-pool/pgbouncer-graph-optimized.ini`

**Optimizations**:
- Increased connection limits for graph workloads (2000 max client connections)
- Enhanced pool sizes (50 default, 20 reserve)
- Optimized timeouts for complex graph queries (300s query timeout)
- Network optimization with TCP keepalive settings

### 5. Monitoring Integration
**Prometheus Metrics**:
- Request count and duration tracking
- Database query performance monitoring
- WebSocket connection metrics
- Cache hit/miss ratios
- High-frequency scraping (10s intervals) for performance monitoring

## üê≥ Container Architecture

### Service Configuration
**Docker Compose Integration**:
```yaml
graph-visualization-api:
  ports: ["8084:8084"]
  resources:
    limits: { cpus: '2.0', memory: 2G }
    reservations: { cpus: '1.0', memory: 1G }
  environment:
    - DATABASE_URL (PostgreSQL connection via PgBouncer)
    - REDIS_HOST/PORT (Cache configuration)
    - CACHE_TTL=300 (5-minute cache expiration)
```

### API Gateway Integration
**Proxy Routes Added**:

### High-Performance Operations
1. **`bulk_insert_nodes(JSONB)`** - Batch node insertion with conflict resolution
2. **`bulk_insert_edges(JSONB)`** - Batch edge creation with weight optimization
3. **`get_connected_nodes(UUID, INTEGER, INTEGER)`** - Graph traversal with depth limits
4. **`get_nodes_in_radius(FLOAT, FLOAT, FLOAT, INTEGER)`** - Spatial proximity queries
5. **`calculate_graph_metrics()`** - Real-time graph analytics

### Materialized Views
- **`graph_popular_tracks`** - Track popularity in graph context
- **`node_centrality`** - Centrality metrics for graph analysis

## üîß Performance Testing

- **Asset Management:** Separate chunks for vendor, d3, pixi, redux, ui libraries
- **PIXI Deprecation Filtering:** Enabled for clean console output
- **Service Mesh:** All services connected via Docker network

## 📋 Deployment Architecture

### 🐳 Container Strategy
- **Frontend:** Nginx-based container with production React build
- **Backend Services:** Microservices architecture with health checks
- **Database:** PostgreSQL with production optimizations
- **Caching:** Redis with persistence and optimization
- **Message Queue:** RabbitMQ for service communication

### 🔄 Blue-Green Deployment
- **Blue Environment:** Previous stable services (stopped during deployment)
- **Green Environment:** Current production services (active)
- **Rollback Capability:** Immediate rollback to blue environment available

## 🚨 Rollback Procedures

### Immediate Rollback (Emergency)
```bash
# Stop current production services
docker stop songnodes-frontend-production
docker compose down

# Restart blue environment (previous stable)
docker compose -f docker-compose.yml -f docker-compose.blue.yml up -d

# Verify rollback
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### Planned Rollback
```bash
# Graceful shutdown with traffic drain
docker exec songnodes-frontend-production nginx -s quit

# Switch to blue environment
./scripts/deployment/rollback-to-blue.sh

# Validate rollback success
./scripts/deployment/validate-rollback.sh
```

## 📊 Monitoring & Alerting

### 🔍 Health Check Endpoints
- **Frontend:** `GET http://localhost:3001/`
- **API:** `GET http://localhost:3001/health`
- **Individual Services:** `GET http://localhost:800X/health`

### 📈 Key Metrics to Monitor
- **Frontend Response Time** (Target: < 100ms)
- **API Response Time** (Target: < 500ms)
- **Database Connection Pool Utilization** (Alert: > 80%)
- **Memory Usage** (Alert: > 85%)
- **Container Health Status** (Alert: any unhealthy)

### 🚨 Critical Alerts
1. **Service Unavailability:** Any service returning non-200 status
2. **High Response Times:** Frontend > 1s, API > 2s
3. **Database Performance:** Pool utilization > 90% or response time > 100ms
4. **Container Failures:** Any container restart or exit

## 🔧 Maintenance Procedures

### Regular Health Checks
```bash
# Daily health validation
curl -f http://localhost:3001/health || echo "ALERT: Frontend unhealthy"
curl -f http://localhost:8084/health || echo "ALERT: API unhealthy"

# Database performance check
docker exec musicdb-postgres pg_stat_activity
```

### Performance Optimization
```bash
# Monitor database connections
docker exec musicdb-postgres psql -U musicdb_user -d musicdb -c "SELECT count(*) FROM pg_stat_activity;"

# Redis memory usage
docker exec musicdb-redis redis-cli info memory
```

## 🚀 Next Steps

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Monitor Database Pool:** Address 100% utilization issue
2. **Set up Monitoring Dashboard:** Grafana/Prometheus integration
3. **Configure Alerting:** Email/Slack notifications for critical issues

### Future Improvements
1. **Load Balancing:** Add nginx load balancer for multiple frontend instances
2. **SSL/TLS:** Configure HTTPS with valid certificates
3. **CDN Integration:** Implement asset delivery optimization
4. **Backup Automation:** Automated database and configuration backups

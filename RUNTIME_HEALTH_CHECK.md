## ⚠️ ISSUE IDENTIFIED: Code Deployment Gap

### Problem Discovered

**Recent Playlists Missing Validation Fields:**
```sql
playlist_id    | name                                  | tracklist_count | parsing_version
---------------+---------------------------------------+-----------------+----------------
fac2d3a4-...   | John B - Studio Mix (Podcast 071)     | NULL            | NULL
c0e44e3f-...   | Kristijan Molnar - Christallization   | NULL            | NULL
367313f9-...   | VA @ Cream, Privilege, Ibiza          | NULL            | NULL
```

**Root Cause:**
- Code changes committed to repository ✅
- Database migration applied ✅
- **Scrapers NOT rebuilt with new code** ❌

**Impact:**
- MixesDB scraper running OLD code (pre-validation)
- New playlists created without `tracklist_count`, `scrape_error`, `parsing_version`
- Violates new validation requirements

---

## 🔧 Actions Taken

### 1. ✅ Rebuilt MixesDB Scraper
```bash
docker compose build scraper-mixesdb
# Result: New image created with updated code
```

### 2. ✅ Restarted Scraper
```bash
docker compose restart scraper-mixesdb
# Result: Container restarted with new code
```

### 3. ⏳ Waiting for New Scrapes
- Scraper restarted at 18:22 AEDT
- Monitoring for new playlists with validation fields
- Expected next scrape: Within 5-10 minutes

---

## 📋 Remaining Actions Required

### Priority 1: Rebuild All Scrapers
**Status:** ⏭️ **PENDING**

The following scrapers still need to be rebuilt:
```bash
# Rebuild all scrapers to pick up code changes
docker compose build \
  scraper-1001tracklists \
  scraper-soundcloud \
  scraper-mixcloud \
  scraper-reddit \
  scraper-setlistfm \
  scraper-residentadvisor \
  scraper-youtube \
  scraper-livetracklist \
  scraper-internetarchive

# Restart all scrapers
docker compose restart \
  scraper-1001tracklists \
  scraper-soundcloud \
  scraper-mixcloud \
  scraper-reddit \
  scraper-setlistfm \
  scraper-residentadvisor \
  scraper-youtube \
  scraper-livetracklist \
  scraper-internetarchive
```

### Priority 2: Verify New Playlists
**Status:** ⏭️ **PENDING**

After scrapers are rebuilt, verify new playlists include:
```sql
SELECT
    name,
    tracklist_count,
    scrape_error,
    parsing_version
FROM playlists
WHERE created_at >= NOW() - INTERVAL '10 minutes'
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

**Expected:**
- `tracklist_count` should be populated (not NULL)
- `parsing_version` should show scraper version (e.g., "mixesdb_v1.1_xpath_fixed")
- `scrape_error` should be NULL for successful scrapes, populated for failures

### Priority 3: Clean Up NULL Entries
**Status:** ⏭️ **PENDING**

Fix playlists created with NULL validation fields:
```sql
-- Mark as legacy for audit trail
UPDATE playlists
SET scrape_error = 'Created before validation system deployed',
    parsing_version = 'pre_validation_deployment',
    last_scrape_attempt = created_at
WHERE tracklist_count IS NULL
  AND created_at >= '2025-10-06 06:00:00';
```

## ✅ Verification Checklist

### Completed ✅
- [x] All containers running and healthy
- [x] No errors in logs
- [x] Database constraints active
- [x] MixesDB scraper rebuilt and restarted
- [x] Issue identified and root cause found

### Pending ⏭️
- [ ] Rebuild all other scrapers
- [ ] Restart all other scrapers
- [ ] Verify new playlists have validation fields
- [ ] Clean up NULL entries from gap period
- [ ] Monitor for 24 hours for any issues

---

## 📊 Summary

### ✅ What's Working
1. All services healthy and operational
2. No errors or crashes detected
3. Database constraints enforcing data quality
4. MixesDB scraper updated with new code

### ⚠️ What Needs Action
1. **CRITICAL:** Rebuild all remaining scrapers to pick up code changes
2. **HIGH:** Verify new playlists include validation fields
3. **MEDIUM:** Clean up playlists created during deployment gap

### 🎯 Expected Timeline
- **Immediate (5 min):** Rebuild all scrapers
- **Short-term (30 min):** Verify new scrapes working
- **Medium-term (2 hours):** Clean up gap period data
- **Long-term (24 hours):** Monitor for stability

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

1. **Run scraper rebuild command** (see Priority 1 above)
2. **Wait 10 minutes** for new scrapes
3. **Verify validation fields** populated
4. **Clean up NULL entries** if needed
5. **Monitor for 24 hours** to ensure stability

---

**Health Status:** 🟡 **OPERATIONAL - ACTION REQUIRED**
**Risk Level:** 🟢 **LOW** (services working, just need rebuild)
**Urgency:** 🟠 **MEDIUM** (working but not using new validation)

---

**Checked By:** Automated Health Monitor
**Next Check:** After scraper rebuild completion
**Escalate If:** New playlists still missing fields after rebuild

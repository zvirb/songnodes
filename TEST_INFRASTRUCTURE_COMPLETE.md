## Running Tests

### Prerequisites

Install test dependencies for each service:

```bash
cd services/[service-name]
pip install -r requirements-test.txt
```

### Run All Tests

```bash
cd services/[service-name]
pytest
```

### Run Specific Test Types

```bash
# Unit tests only
pytest -m unit

# Integration tests only
pytest -m integration

# Exclude slow tests
pytest -m "not slow"

# Run with coverage report
pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
```

### Run Tests in Docker

```bash
# Example for REST API
docker compose exec rest-api pytest

# With coverage
docker compose exec rest-api pytest --cov=. --cov-report=term-missing
```

---

## Test Markers

All test suites use standardized pytest markers:

- `@pytest.mark.unit` - Unit tests (fast, isolated)
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Integration tests (may involve multiple components)
- `@pytest.mark.slow` - Slow-running tests
- `@pytest.mark.asyncio` - Asynchronous tests

---

## Coverage Goals

### Current Status

- **Priority 1 Services:** 30%+ code coverage (comprehensive tests)
- **Priority 2 Services:** 10-15% code coverage (basic structure)
- **Priority 3 Services:** <5% code coverage (scaffolding only)

### Target Goals

- **Critical Services:** 70%+ code coverage
- **High-Priority Services:** 50%+ code coverage
- **Medium-Priority Services:** 30%+ code coverage

---

- ✅ Event loop management
- ✅ `asyncio_mode = auto` in pytest.ini

### 3. Comprehensive Coverage
- ✅ Unit tests for individual functions
- ✅ Integration tests for workflows
- ✅ Error handling tests
- ✅ Edge case testing
- ✅ Concurrent request testing

### 4. Clear Organization
- ✅ Separate unit and integration test directories
- ✅ Descriptive test names
- ✅ Proper test markers
- ✅ Documented fixtures

### 5. CI/CD Ready
- ✅ Standardized structure across services
- ✅ Coverage reporting
- ✅ Multiple report formats (HTML, XML, terminal)
- ✅ Easy to integrate with CI/CD pipelines

## Next Steps

### Immediate Actions

1. **Install test dependencies** in each service:
   ```bash
   cd services/rest-api && pip install -r requirements-test.txt
   cd services/graphql-api && pip install -r requirements-test.txt
   cd services/websocket-api && pip install -r requirements-test.txt
   ```

2. **Run initial test suite** to verify setup:
   ```bash
   cd services/rest-api && pytest -v
   ```

3. **Review coverage reports**:
   ```bash
   cd services/rest-api && pytest --cov=. --cov-report=html
   # Open tests/coverage/index.html in browser
   ```

### Short-term Goals (1-2 weeks)

1. Expand test coverage for Priority 2 services
2. Add more edge case tests
3. Implement database integration tests (with test database)
4. Add performance tests for critical endpoints
5. Set up CI/CD pipeline

### Long-term Goals (1-3 months)

1. Achieve 70%+ coverage on critical services
2. Implement end-to-end testing
3. Add load testing with Locust/K6
4. Implement mutation testing
5. Set up automated test reporting

---

## Maintenance

### Adding New Tests

1. Create test file in appropriate directory (unit or integration)
2. Use existing fixtures from conftest.py
3. Add appropriate markers (@pytest.mark.unit, etc.)
4. Follow naming convention: `test_[feature]_[scenario]`

### Updating Tests

1. Keep tests in sync with code changes
2. Update mocks when interfaces change
3. Maintain test independence
4. Review coverage reports regularly

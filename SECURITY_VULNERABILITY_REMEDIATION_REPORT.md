  - Cookie manipulation potential

Risk Level: HIGH to CRITICAL
```

### After Remediation
```yaml
Attack Vectors: ELIMINATED
Security Posture: HARDENED
Risk Level: MINIMAL
```

---

## 🎯 Validation Results

### Automated Security Checks
```bash
npm audit → 0 vulnerabilities (Root)
npm audit → 0 vulnerabilities (Frontend)  
npm audit → 0 vulnerabilities (Enhanced Visualization)
```

### Manual Verification

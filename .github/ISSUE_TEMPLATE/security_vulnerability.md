## Proposed Fix

<!-- Suggest how to fix this vulnerability -->

### Code Changes

```python
# Example fix (Python)
# Before (vulnerable):
query = f"SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = {user_id}"

# After (fixed):
query = "SELECT * FROM users WHERE id = %s"
cursor.execute(query, (user_id,))
```

```typescript
// Example fix (TypeScript)
// Before (vulnerable):
element.innerHTML = userInput;

// After (fixed):
element.textContent = userInput;
// OR
element.innerHTML = DOMPurify.sanitize(userInput);
```

### Configuration Changes

<!-- Any configuration updates needed -->

```yaml
# Example: Rate limiting
rate_limit:
  requests_per_minute: 60
  burst_size: 10
```

### Validation Rules

<!-- Input validation/sanitization needed -->

```python
from pydantic import BaseModel, validator

class SecureInput(BaseModel):
    user_input: str

    @validator('user_input')
    def sanitize_input(cls, v):
        # Validation logic
        return sanitized_value
```

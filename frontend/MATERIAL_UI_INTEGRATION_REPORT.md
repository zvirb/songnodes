- Typography configuration with Inter font family
- Component-level customizations for consistent styling
- Visualization-specific theme extensions for z-index and performance settings

### 3. Theme Provider Integration ✅
**File:** `/src/theme/ThemeProvider.tsx`
- React component that wraps the application with MUI ThemeProvider
- Automatically syncs with Redux UI state for dark/light mode switching
- Includes CssBaseline for consistent baseline styles

### 4. Enhanced Search Panel ✅
**File:** `/src/components/SearchPanel/EnhancedMuiSearchPanel.tsx`
- Complete Material-UI reimplementation of the original search panel
- Features:
  - Material-UI TextField with advanced input styling
  - Autocomplete with genre selection
  - Slider components for BPM and year range filtering
  - Chip components for quick filters and search results
  - Card and List components for results display
  - Responsive Grid layout for advanced filters
  - Smooth animations and transitions
  - Accessibility improvements with proper ARIA attributes

### 5. Application Integration ✅
**File:** `/src/App.tsx`
- Wrapped main application with ThemeProvider
- Added toggle functionality between original and MUI search panels
- Floating Action Button (FAB) for switching between search panel styles
- Material-UI components coexist with existing Tailwind CSS styling

### 6. Build Configuration ✅
**Files:** `vite.config.ts`, `tsconfig.json`, `package.json`
- Updated Vite configuration with MUI dependencies optimization
- Added theme path alias for clean imports
- Resolved Storybook version conflicts
- Separate chunk bundling for MUI components for optimal loading

## Compatibility Validation

### PIXI.js Integration ✅
- Material-UI themes properly integrate with PIXI.js background colors
- No conflicts between MUI emotion styles and PIXI.js Canvas rendering
- Z-index management ensures proper layering between MUI components and PIXI.js

### D3.js Integration ✅
- D3.js SVG elements can access MUI theme colors via `useTheme()` hook
- No style conflicts between MUI's CSS-in-JS and D3.js element styling
- Responsive design works correctly with D3.js visualizations

### Redux Integration ✅
- Theme provider successfully reads from Redux UI state
- No performance impact on existing Redux state management
- Existing selectors and actions remain unaffected

## Performance Considerations

### Bundle Size Impact
- MUI components are code-split into separate chunk (`mui.js`)
- Tree-shaking enabled to include only used components
- Estimated bundle size increase: ~150KB gzipped

### Runtime Performance
- Theme provider uses memoization to prevent unnecessary re-renders
- MUI components are optimized for React 18 Concurrent Mode
- No impact on PIXI.js or D3.js rendering performance

## Features Implemented

### 1. Enhanced Search Experience
- **Autocomplete Genre Selection**: Multi-select dropdown with all supported genres
- **Range Sliders**: Interactive sliders for BPM (60-200) and release year (1950-present)
- **Visual Quick Filters**: Emoji-enhanced chips showing count statistics
- **Advanced Search Panel**: Collapsible section with comprehensive filtering options
- **Search Results Display**: Card-based layout with score indicators and genre chips
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full keyboard support with arrow keys and Enter

### 2. Theme Synchronization
- **Dark/Light Mode**: Automatic switching based on Redux UI state
- **Brand Colors**: Custom palette matching SongNodes visual identity
- **Graph Integration**: Theme colors available for visualization components
- **Responsive Design**: Optimized for mobile, tablet, and desktop viewports

### 3. Accessibility Improvements
- **ARIA Labels**: Proper labeling for screen readers
- **Focus Management**: Logical tab order and focus indicators  
- **Color Contrast**: WCAG AA compliant color combinations
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Full functionality without mouse

## Usage Instructions

### Switching Between Search Panels
1. Use the floating action button (palette icon) in the bottom-right corner
2. Toggle between original Tailwind-styled and new Material-UI search panels
3. Both panels maintain the same functionality and Redux state

### Theme Customization
```tsx
import { useTheme } from '@mui/material/styles';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const theme = useTheme();
  // Access theme colors: theme.palette.primary.main
  // Access graph colors: theme.palette.graph.selectedNode
  // Check dark mode: theme.palette.mode === 'dark'
};
```

### Using MUI Components
```tsx
import { Button, TextField, Card } from '@mui/material';
import { Search as SearchIcon } from '@mui/icons-material';

// Components automatically inherit theme styling
<Button variant="contained" startIcon={<SearchIcon />}>
  Search
</Button>
```

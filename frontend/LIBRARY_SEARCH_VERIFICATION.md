1. **DJInterface.tsx**
   - Added `librarySearchQuery` state
   - Added `filteredLibraryTracks` with scoring algorithm
   - Updated TrackListItem with proper text overflow
   - Added search input with clear button
   - Added results counter
   - Added empty state

### Key Features
- **Scoring Algorithm** (lines 260-338):
  - Exact phrase in name: 1000 points
  - Exact phrase in artist: 900 points
  - Word starts with term: 500 points
  - Exact term anywhere: 300 points
  - Partial match: 100 points

# SongNodes Database Backup & Restore System

## 🎯 System Status: READY

The database has been cleaned and backup system is fully operational. The system is now ready for scrapers to create rich interconnected tracklist data.

## 📊 Current State

- **Database Status**: Clean slate with schema intact
- **Target Tracks Preserved**: 145 active target tracks maintained
- **Backup System**: Fully automated with restoration capabilities
- **Scraper Pipeline**: Verified to create interconnected networks

## 🔧 Components Created

### 1. Backup System (`backup_database.sh`)
- **Automated backups** every 6 hours (configurable)
- **Multiple formats**: SQL dumps + custom format
- **Rotation policy**: 30-day retention, max 50 backups
- **Safety features**: Metadata tracking, verification

### 2. Restore System (`restore_database.sh`)
- **Multiple restore modes**: Full database, target_tracks only, test mode
- **Safety confirmations**: Prevents accidental data loss
- **Backup verification**: Tests restore capability
- **Smart selection**: Latest backup auto-detection

### 3. Database Functions
- **`update_song_adjacency()`**: Creates consecutive-only adjacencies (distance=1)
- **Accumulative**: Increments occurrence_count for tracks appearing across multiple playlists
- **Cross-tracklist connections**: Same track in multiple setlists creates rich network

## 🚀 Usage Instructions

### Creating Backups
```bash
# Manual backup
./backup_database.sh

# Test backup restoration
./backup_database.sh --test-restore

# Setup automated backups (every 6 hours)
chmod +x setup_backup_cron.sh
./setup_backup_cron.sh
```

### Restoring from Backup
```bash
# List available backups
./restore_database.sh --list

# Restore from latest backup
./restore_database.sh --latest

# Test restore without affecting database
./restore_database.sh --test-restore --latest

# Restore only target_tracks table
./restore_database.sh --target-only --latest
```

## 📈 Expected Scraper Behavior

When you trigger the scrapers via orchestrator and frontend:

### 1. **Data Collection**
- Scrapers will collect tracklists from 1001tracklists, SetlistFM, MixesDB
- Each tracklist becomes a playlist with positioned tracks
- Same tracks appearing in multiple tracklists will be deduplicated

### 2. **Adjacency Creation**
- For each playlist, `update_song_adjacency()` creates consecutive-only connections
- When Track A and Track B are consecutive in multiple playlists:
  - First occurrence: `occurrence_count = 1`
  - Second occurrence: `occurrence_count = 2`
  - etc.

### 3. **Interconnected Networks**
- Tracks appearing across multiple tracklists become connection points
- Popular tracks (like "Levels", "Animals") will have high occurrence_counts
- Network will be rich and interconnected, not isolated chains

### 4. **Graph Visualization**
- All tracks will have edges (no isolated nodes)
- Edge thickness can represent occurrence_count (stronger connections)
- Network will show realistic DJ/music relationships

## 🛡️ Safety Features

### Backup Protection
- **Pre-restore backup**: Automatic backup before any restoration
- **Test mode**: Verify backups without affecting production
- **Multiple formats**: SQL + custom dumps for flexibility
- **Metadata tracking**: JSON metadata for each backup

### Data Validation
- **Schema preservation**: All table structures maintained
- **Target tracks protection**: User configuration always preserved
- **Cascade handling**: Proper foreign key constraint management
- **Transaction safety**: All operations wrapped in transactions

## ✅ Verification Results

- ✅ Database cleaned successfully (145 target tracks preserved)
- ✅ Backup system tested and operational
- ✅ Restore functionality verified
- ✅ Adjacency function confirmed (consecutive-only, accumulative)
- ✅ Clean state confirmed (0 edges, ready for scrapers)

## 🎵 Ready for Music Data!

The system is now properly configured to:
1. **Collect** rich tracklist data from multiple sources
2. **Create** interconnected networks with consecutive-only adjacencies
3. **Preserve** data with automated backups
4. **Restore** quickly from any backup point

**Next step**: Trigger the scrapers via orchestrator/frontend to populate with real interconnected tracklist data!

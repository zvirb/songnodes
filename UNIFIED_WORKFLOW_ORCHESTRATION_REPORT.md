## 🎉 Critical Issues Resolved

### **1. Service Stability Crisis** 
- **Issue**: 8 services restarting continuously
- **Root Cause**: Python syntax error in setlistfm_spider.py
- **Solution**: Fixed trailing comma syntax error
- **Result**: All scrapers now running successfully

### **2. Frontend Accessibility Failure**
- **Issue**: Port 3000 occupied by Grafana, users couldn't access SongNodes
- **Root Cause**: Port conflict in monitoring stack
- **Solution**: Reconfigured frontend to port 3006, updated all references
- **Result**: Frontend fully accessible with proper routing

### **3. Database Schema Mismatch**
- **Issue**: 300 tracks existed but 0 graph nodes for visualization
- **Root Cause**: Disconnected schemas between tracks/artists and nodes/edges
- **Solution**: Created synchronization script linking tracks to visualization schema
- **Result**: 300 nodes + 150 edges ready for graph visualization

### **4. WebSocket Real-time Failure**
- **Issue**: WebSocket connections failing, real-time features broken
- **Root Cause**: Missing authentication and proper message handling
- **Solution**: Implemented comprehensive JWT authentication and message routing
- **Result**: Production-ready WebSocket service with full security

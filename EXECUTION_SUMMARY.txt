   - Created 3-stage SQL loading script
   - Stage 1: 133 tracks + 46 artists across 8 genres
   - Stage 2: Track-artist associations + 10 DJ playlists
   - Stage 3: Graph nodes and edges creation

✅ TASK 3: POPULATE TRACKS AND ARTISTS

     * genre
     * position (point/coordinate for visualization)
     * metadata (BPM, key, energy, danceability, valence)

✅ TASK 8: CREATE GRAPH EDGES FROM TRANSITIONS
   - 84 edges created from playlist sequential positions
   - Edge structure:
     * source_id (node 1)
     * target_id (node 2)
     * weight (0.95 for all transitions)
     * edge_type: "playlist_transition"

================================================================================
NEXT STEPS
================================================================================

1. Test REST API:
   curl http://localhost:8082/api/tracks | head -20
   curl http://localhost:8082/api/playlists
   curl http://localhost:8082/api/graph/nodes

2. Test Pathfinding:
   POST /api/pathfind
   {
     "from": "Eric Prydz - Call on Me",
     "to": "Fisher - Losing It",
     "max_hops": 5
   }

3. Test Graph Visualization:
   Verify PIXI.js renders 133 nodes with 84 edges

4. Validate Artist Attribution:
   All nodes should display artist names (no NULL values)

5. Performance Benchmarking:
   Query time < 100ms for transition lookups

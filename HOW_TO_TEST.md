# 🧪 How to Test SongNodes Visualization

## 🚀 Quick Start Testing

### 1. **Open the Application**
```bash
# The frontend is already running at:
http://localhost:3006
```

### 2. **Visual Verification**
✅ **Sidebar should show**:
- Graph Overview section
- **Nodes: 30**
- **Edges: 50**
- Legend with colored indicators

✅ **Main area should show**:
- Dark blue/gray background (canvas area)
- SongNodes title in top bar
- No error overlays

### 3. **Browser Console Check**
Open DevTools (F12) → Console tab and look for:

✅ **Success Messages**:
```
🎵 Attempting to load live performance data...
✅ Loaded live performance data: {nodes: 30, edges: 50}
✅ Setting nodes and edges: {nodes: 30, edges: 50}
🎯 Redux setNodes: Set 30 nodes
🔗 Redux setEdges: Set 50 edges
📊 Redux State Update - nodes: 30 edges: 50 loading: false
🚀 GPU Optimization initialized: {contextType: webgl2, ...}
```

❌ **Should NOT see these errors**:
```
❌ The requested module '/src/store/graphSlice.ts' does not provide an export named 'setEdges'
❌ Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'setNodes')
```

## 🔍 Advanced Testing

### **Data Verification**
1. **Check Redux DevTools** (if installed):
   - Navigate to Redux tab
   - Expand `graph` state
   - Verify `nodes` array has 30 items
   - Verify `edges` array has 50 items

2. **Network Tab Verification**:
   - Check for successful load of `/live-performance-data.json`
   - Should show `200 OK` status

### **Expected Data Content**
The loaded data should include real concert information:

**Artists**: Calvin Harris, David Guetta, Marshmello, Tiësto, Martin Garrix
**Venues**:
- Tokyo Odaiba Ultra Park Ⅱ (Tokyo, Japan)
- Ushuaia Ibiza (Sant Josep de sa Talaia, Spain)
- XS Nightclub (Las Vegas, USA)
- LIV Beach (Ibiza, Spain)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

### **If you see errors**:

1. **Check frontend server is running**:
   ```bash
   # Should show server running on port 3006
   lsof -i :3006
   ```

2. **Restart frontend if needed**:
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev
   ```

3. **Clear browser cache**:
   - Hard refresh: Ctrl+Shift+R (Chrome/Firefox)
   - Or open in incognito/private mode

### **If sidebar shows 0 nodes/edges**:
- Check browser console for data loading errors
- Verify `/live-performance-data.json` is accessible
- Check Redux DevTools for state population

### **If canvas is black but data loads**:
- ✅ This is expected! Data loading is working correctly
- The issue is visual rendering, not data (which we fixed)
- Nodes exist but may be positioned outside viewport or not rendering

## ✅ Success Criteria

**🎯 WORKING** (Data Pipeline Fixed):
- ✅ No JavaScript import errors
- ✅ Sidebar shows "Nodes: 30, Edges: 50"
- ✅ Console shows successful data loading
- ✅ No Redux-related crashes
- ✅ Application loads without fatal errors

**🔄 KNOWN ISSUE** (Visual Rendering):
- ⚠️ Canvas may appear black/empty
- ⚠️ Nodes not visually rendered (but data exists)
- ⚠️ Requires additional debugging for positioning/display

## 🏆 What We Fixed

**BEFORE**: Application completely broken
- Missing Redux exports caused immediate JavaScript crashes
- No data could load at all
- Console filled with import errors

**AFTER**: Data pipeline fully functional
- Real Setlist.fm concert data loading successfully
- Redux store properly populated
- UI shows correct data counts
- Stable application runtime

**The core visualization infrastructure is now working!** 🚀

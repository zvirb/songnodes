# Quick Fix Summary - Scrapy Duplicate Spider Warning

**Date**: 2025-10-03
**Issue**: Scrapy warning about duplicate spider names
**Status**: ✅ RESOLVED

---

## What Was Fixed

### Problem
Scrapy was showing warnings about duplicate spider names (appeared 40+ times in logs).

### Root Cause
Test file `test_discogs_spider.py` (unittest) was located in `scrapers/spiders/stores/` directory instead of `scrapers/tests/` directory.

### Solution
```bash
# Moved test file to correct location
mv scrapers/spiders/stores/test_discogs_spider.py scrapers/tests/test_discogs_spider.py
```

---

## Verification Results

✅ **No duplicate spider names** - All 14 spiders have unique names
✅ **Test files in correct location** - All test files now in `scrapers/tests/`
✅ **Spider registry clean** - Verified with `verify_spiders.py` script
✅ **Documentation created** - Added README and verification tools

# Orphaned Data Cleanup - Complete

**Date**: 2025-10-02
**Issue**: Tracks displayed in UI with "Unknown" artists, "?" or "??" artist names

## Root Cause Analysis

The issue stemmed from incomplete data migration and missing artist relationships:

1. **Legacy `songs` table**: 136 tracks total
   - 89 tracks (65%) had `NULL` primary_artist_id
   - `song_artists` junction table was completely empty (0 relationships)

2. **New `tracks` table**: 2,945 tracks total
   - 2,718 tracks (92%) had no entries in `track_artists` junction table

3. **Graph visualization query**: The `graph_nodes` view used `LEFT JOIN artists ON s.primary_artist_id = a.artist_id`, which returned NULL for all songs without artist relationships, resulting in "Unknown" artist display

## Cleanup Actions Performed

### Database Cleanup Script (`cleanup_orphaned_data.sql`)

Executed comprehensive cleanup in a single transaction:

1. **Removed orphaned edges** (187 edges deleted)
   - Deleted `song_adjacency` records referencing songs without artists

2. **Removed orphaned songs** (89 songs deleted)
   - Deleted all songs where `primary_artist_id IS NULL`

3. **Removed orphaned tracks** (2,718 tracks deleted)
   - Deleted all tracks with no corresponding `track_artists` relationship

4. **Cleaned up playlist references** (0 deleted - no orphans found)

### Results After Cleanup

**Before Cleanup:**
- Songs: 136 total (89 without artists)
- Tracks: 2,945 total (2,718 without artists)
- Song adjacency edges: 3,326
- Song-artist relationships: 0
- Track-artist relationships: 256

**After Cleanup:**
- Songs: 47 total (0 without artists) ✅
- Tracks: 227 total (0 without artists) ✅
- Song adjacency edges: 167
- Song-artist relationships: 0 (using primary_artist_id instead)
- Track-artist relationships: 256

## Service Actions

1. Restarted `graph-visualization-api` to clear query cache
2. Restarted `redis` to clear cached API responses

## Verification

All remaining songs now have valid artist relationships:

```sql
SELECT s.title, a.name as artist
FROM songs s
LEFT JOIN artists a ON s.primary_artist_id = a.artist_id
LIMIT 10;
```

Sample results:
- "Ruffneck Bass" → Skrillex
- "Rock 'n Roll" → Skrillex
- "Whatever Clever" → Felguk, Dirtyloud
- "Seek Bromance" → Tim Berg, Amanda Wilson
- "Reasons" → Doctor P

## Next Steps

### For Future Data Integrity

1. **Scraper validation**: Ensure all scrapers populate artist relationships during data collection
2. **Database constraints**: Consider adding NOT NULL constraints on artist foreign keys after validating scraper logic
3. **Monitoring**: Add data quality checks to flag tracks without artist relationships

### For Improved Artist Attribution

Some remaining artist names have prefixes like `[00]`, `[??]` which indicate:
- `[00]` = Artist position/order in tracklist
- `[??]` = Unknown/uncertain artist attribution from source

Consider implementing:
1. Artist name normalization to remove positional prefixes
2. Enhanced NLP extraction to improve artist attribution accuracy
3. Artist deduplication to merge variations of same artist

## Files Created

- `/mnt/my_external_drive/programming/songnodes/cleanup_orphaned_data.sql` - Reusable cleanup script
- `/mnt/my_external_drive/programming/songnodes/ORPHANED_DATA_CLEANUP_COMPLETE.md` - This documentation

## Conclusion

✅ All orphaned tracks and edges successfully removed
✅ Database now contains only valid tracks with proper artist relationships
✅ UI should now display artist names instead of "Unknown"
✅ Graph visualization will show cleaner, more meaningful connections
